ALL-C,Cat,All in One Supplements,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/All-in-one-Cat-Banner.jpg,How will All in One Supplements help me?,"All-in-One supplements are exactly what they imply: all the ingredients you might require for your nutritional needs, in one convenient delivery system. All-in-One, however, does not necessarily mean universally beneficial. Different people need different types of nutrition, depending on their training and nutritional goals. Ingredients universal to the majority of all-in-one supplements include protein (often more than one kind), carbohydrates, creatine, amino acids, and often a vitamin blend. Additional ingredients vary based on the goal of the specific supplement: general meal replacement, diet supplement, post-workout, mass gainer, ect… All-in-One supplements often contain superfood blends and healthy fats. These are designed to bridge the nutritional gap in the average individual’s diet. Superfood blends usually contain an array of vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables, particularly of those known for their health benefits, such as acai. The superfood blends contain the key components (vitamins and minerals) in higher quantities than eating the daily-recommended amount of fruits and vegetables alone. 
Healthy fats are essential to weight management and insulin control. The nature of modern diets, particularly restrictive and weight loss diets, results in healthy fats often being left out due to caloric content. However, the benefits of healthy fats to a well-rounded diet cannot be overstated. Look for Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats. ",How to tell good All in One Supplements from the bad ones,"As stated above, All-in-One supplements contain similar base ingredients. Past that, they will vary in the amounts and types of protein and carbohydrates, and the content of secondary ingredients. Generally, all-in-one supplements come in a mixable powder form. They can also be found in the form of protein bars or (rarely) pill form.",Reasons to use All in one supplements as a diet aid,"Diet Support: Some all-in-one supplements offer easy, complete, low-calorie nutrition for those on restricted diets. These supplements are usually much more palatable, and healthier, than typical diet food. Superfood and vitamin blends are particularly beneficial to dieters, since restrictive diets can lead to multiple deficiencies. Post-Workout: Every serious athlete knows about the post workout window in which you should replenish your carbohydrate (glycogen) stores and provide your muscles with quality protein, amino acids, and creatine to repair and build. Post-workout all-in-one supplements often double as meal replacements. They usually contain both fast and slow digesting protein and carbohydrates. A vitamin blend is also important to protect your hard-working immune system. Mass/Weight Gainers: This is where All-in-One supplements shine. As frustrating as it can be for overweight individuals to lose weight, it’s sometimes more frustrating for “hard gainers” to put on weight. There are so many options available for weight loss, but not many for individuals who want to gain mass. Eating constantly to meet high-calorie diets can be tiring and time consuming. All-in-one mass gainers provide complete nutrition with high, quality caloric value. ",,,
AMI-C,Cat,Amino Acid Supplements,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Amino-Acid-Cat-Banner.jpg,How will Amino Acid Supplements help me?,"Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet. Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics. ",How to tell good Amino Acid Supplements from the bad ones,"As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. 
Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system. L-Proline – Proline is becoming increasingly popular for it’s role in skin health, and is said to have anti-aging properties L-Serine – This amino acid is most popular for its treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other neurological disorders",Basic Breakdown of amino acids,"There are 20 different types of amino’s and 8 are essential, its important that you get the best amino acid supplement for your goals, the amino’s you need in the product you choose should benefit what you’re trying to achieve whether its muscle building or improved workout our experts will take you through each amino acid supplement and show you its strengths and help you make an informed decision as to the best amino acid supplement for you.",,,

Of these, 22 are considered Proteinogenic, meaning they are the building blocks of complex proteins. And of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, 3 are branched-chained in their cellular structure.

Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are a necessity for athletes strength training. Human muscle mass is comprised of approximately 33% BCAAs, and unfortunately our modern diets (even healthy ones) do not contain the BCAAs your body needs to be at your best. Naturally, numerous scientific studies boast of the benefits of BCAA supplementation for athletes of all ages and fitness levels.During exercise, your body oxidizes BCAAs at a very high rate. If BCAAs are not replenished in a timely manner, muscle recovery and subsequent exercise performance is hindered. Research studies on BCAA supplementation both prior to and during workouts showed an average of 10-15% more endurance vs. the effects of a placebo.The three potent BCAAs for athletic performance are L-Leucine, l-Valine, and L-Isoleucine. For maximum benefits, researchers recommend a blend of BCAAs comprised of at least 40% L-Leucine. The remainder should be equal parts Valine and Isoleucine.BCAAs promote not only muscle growth, but fat oxidation and hormone balance. By promoting glucose tolerance, your body will utilize more of the fat you have naturally stored as an energy source (and in the process boost your overall metabolic rate).The most immediate and notable effect from BCAA supplementation is how much more endurance you’ll have during, and how much less sore your muscles will feel following a tough workout. As they are the building block of muscle tissue, they inhibit muscle breakdown. Breaking down less muscle means less lactic acid build-up. Subsequently, you’ll recover faster and feel less sore overall the next day.
",BCAA's and protein synthesis ,"BCAA Supplements are especially useful in 2 areas. Firstly BCAA’s improve protein synthesis so the your protein intake translates more efficiently into muscle gain results. Secondly BCAA’s discourage the breakdown of muscle during weight loss, so if you are losing serious weight going for extra muscle definition BCAA supplements will help stop your diet impacting your muscle mass.",,,

Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet. Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics. ",How to tell good Mass gain Supplements from the bad ones,"As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. 
Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system. L-Proline – Proline is becoming increasingly popular for it’s role in skin health, and is said to have anti-aging properties L-Serine – This amino acid is most popular for its treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other neurological disorders",Creatine pills vs creatine powder - Which is best?,"There are 20 different types of amino’s and 8 are essential, its important that you get the best amino acid supplement for your goals, the amino’s you need in the product you choose should benefit what you’re trying to achieve whether its muscle building or improved workout our experts will take you through each amino acid supplement and show you its strengths and help you make an informed decision as to the best amino acid supplement for you.",,,

In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet. Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics. ",How to tell good Protein Bars from the bad ones,"As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. 
Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system. L-Proline – Proline is becoming increasingly popular for it’s role in skin health, and is said to have anti-aging properties L-Serine – This amino acid is most popular for its treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other neurological disorders",Creatine pills vs creatine powder - Which is best?,"There are 20 different types of amino’s and 8 are essential, its important that you get the best amino acid supplement for your goals, the amino’s you need in the product you choose should benefit what you’re trying to achieve whether its muscle building or improved workout our experts will take you through each amino acid supplement and show you its strengths and help you make an informed decision as to the best amino acid supplement for you.",,,
SPO-C,Cat,Sports Supplements,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sport-supplement-Cat-Banner.jpg,How will Sports Supplements help me?,"Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss.

Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.

Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics. ",Are Amino Acids products for me?,"As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. 
Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system. L-Proline – Proline is becoming increasingly popular for it’s role in skin health, and is said to have anti-aging properties L-Serine – This amino acid is most popular for its treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other neurological disorders",How to tell good Amino Acids supplements from bad ones,"There are 20 different types of amino’s and 8 are essential, its important that you get the best amino acid supplement for your goals, the amino’s you need in the product you choose should benefit what you’re trying to achieve whether its muscle building or improved workout our experts will take you through each amino acid supplement and show you its strengths and help you make an informed decision as to the best amino acid supplement for you.",,,

For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.

Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.

CRE-I,Ingred,Creatine,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/example-ingredient.jpg,What is Creatine?,"First, a little background: At the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O. You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract. This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give. Enter: Creatine. Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule. Now, your ATP stores are building back up. Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine. Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout. In food, creatine is found in meat products – but again, not in high quantities. Creatine supplementation is recommended for nearly all athletes for this reason. ",Are Creatine products for me?,"Since the purpose of creatine is to replenish and build energy stores in your muscles, you should start seeing a notable difference in you exercise endurance, strength level, and overall recovery times. Most creatine supplements recommend a “loading phase”, since creatine takes time to build up in your system. Don’t be surprised if it takes up to two weeks to notice a difference. Creatine is lesser known for giving athletes a bit of a post-workout pump. After ingestion, creatine causes muscle cells to retain more water. This means that you need to hydrate especially well when taking creatine, but the extra water not only gives you a fuller look, but will help you recover faster. Due to the nature of their dietary restrictions, vegetarians and vegans benefit most from creatine supplementation. ",How to tell good Creatine supplements from bad ones,"Creatine is available in several forms. While there is debate as to which type of creatine works best, scientific studies are overall inconclusive. Unfortunately, an EFSA study found that over half of the creatine supplements available today contain contaminants. Bottom line: the most important factor is the standards by which the creatine is processed for purity. Creatine supplements differ by composition, solubility, and effectiveness. Creatine Monohydrate: The most widely sold form of creatine, it is usually the most effective creatine in performance studies. It is not water-soluble, so don’t expect it to dissolve easily in your recovery drink. It needs to be ingested quickly so that it does not denature. That being said, due to its chemical structure, it doesn’t require a loading period before you begin to experience the benefits. Micronized Creatine: Micronized creatine is creatine monohydrate that has been, well… micronized. This means that the creatine molecules have been decreased in size to improve absorption. While it does require a loading phase, the ease of absorption reduces side effects associated with regular creatine monohydrate – namely bloating and stomach discomfort from water retention. However, athletes that don’t respond to creatine monohydrate should respond particularly well to micronized creatine. Additionally, the additional processing required to make micronized creatine results in an almost universally pure product. Creatine Ethyl Ester: This form of creatine is bonded to an ester molecule. The importance of this additional molecule is that it changes the overall ionic charge of the molecule. By doing this, creatine ethyl ester’s absorption rate is nearly 99%. Like creatine monohydrate, creatine ethyl ester does not require a loading phase. There is no stomach discomfort or bloating associated with this form of creatine. Creatine Citrate: Like creatine ethyl ester, creatine citrate is creatine that has been bonded to an additional molecule (citric acid) to increase overall absorption. Creatine citrate is more stable than creatine monohydrate, and is slightly more water-soluble. This form of creatine is rarely found in its own supplement – it is usually combined with other supplements such as All-in-One’s or Meal Replacements Creatine Malate: Creatine Malate is another bonded creatine – in this case it is bonded with malic acid to boost absorption levels. As with other forms of bonded creatine, stomach discomfort is much less likely to occur. Creatine malate comes in two forms: tri-creatine malate and di-creatine malate. Tri creatine malate contains 3 monohydrate molecules, and di0creatine malate has two. The additional monohydrate molecules, in addition to the malic acid, aid in the formation of ATP at the cellular level.

",How to tell good L-Leucine supplements from bad ones,"First, a little background: At the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O. You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract. This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give. Enter: Creatine. Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule. Now, your ATP stores are building back up.

PRO-I,Ingred,Protein,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/example-ingredient.jpg,What is Protein?,"Protein is one of the major macronutrients (the others being Fat and Carbohydrates). It is naturally abundant in foods such as meat, dairy products, nuts and beans. Protein is vital to every critical function in the body. Protein is comprised of amino acids – another supplement often found on its own. Your muscles are made of amino acids (as a foundation) and use amino acids to build and repair, as well as fuel bodily functions. Amino acids are also important building blocks for healthy skin, hair, nails and bone density. Therefore, individuals that don’t get enough protein in their diets often find that their overall health and appearance will suffer, even if they are otherwise healthy. Even as recent as 100 years ago, protein was the main source of caloric intake in human diets. However, the rise of industry, mass food production, and changes to the typical modern diet has resulted in a shift toward carbohydrates and unhealthy fats as the primary source of calories (cereal, bread, pasta). 
Quality protein sources tend to be more expensive now, and are generally more work to cook and prepare for the busy individual. Protein supplements are ideal to meet nutritional needs quickly and conveniently. ",Are Protein products for me?,"Typical protein supplements can range anywhere from 30-95% protein by weight. The type of protein and the way in which it is processed determines the quality of the supplement. 
Concentrate, Isolate, and Hydrolyzed (based on whey – the most common kind of protein): 
Protein Concentrate is generally the most affordable protein as it is the least processed and generally the most complete in terms of amino acids and peptides. However, it is also the most varied in terms of the amount of protein per gram. 
Protein Isolate is the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body. It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but often lacking in complete amino profiles offered by concentrate. Hydrolyzed Protein is isolate that is further broken down, and essentially “pre-digested”. The smaller peptide chains are more readily absorbed into your bloodstream than any other kind of protein. However, the process by which hydrolyzed protein is made causes some of the more beneficial properties to denature. ",How to tell good Protein supplements from bad ones,"Animal-based proteins: Whey and Casein, and Egg Both proteins come from dairy milk. The milk you buy at the grocery store is about 20% whey and 80% casein protein. The difference between the two is how your body digests them. Whey is often considered the ideal fast-acting protein since it is so easily absorbed – perfect for post-workout replenishment and growth. Whey protein is particularly high in essential amino acids – meaning the ones your body doesn’t produce and needs to get from food to function properly. Since it is the most popular and most common type of protein, whey is available in a myriad of flavours and forms. Casein protein has a different amino acid profile than whey, and is very slowly digested. This protein is ideal for endurance performance and highly recommended prior to any period of fasting (ie: sleep!). Casein forms a gel-like substance in your stomach after ingestion, so your body takes much longer to process it than whey. This translates into a very steady stream of amino acids over a long period of time (usually 7 hours or so). Egg Protein is made from a process that involved separating the yolks from the white and dehydrating the whites. It is very protein dense, providing approximately 4 times the amount found in one egg in per serving. Eggs are naturally high in vitamins and minerals, making them a great option for the lactose-intolerant crowd. Plant-Based Protein: Plant-based proteins are constantly growing in popularity for lactose intolerant, gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian populations. These proteins make it easier for people on limited diets to meet their protein needs. Plants are naturally high in fiber and don’t often need the same artificial flavouring that other protein sources use. Plant proteins are varied in their vitamin and amino profiles, yet they can be more robust than some animal proteins in this respect. For this reason, plant proteins are usually combined to give the most complete nutritional profile.

WHEY-I,Ingred,Whey Protein,https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/example-ingredient.jpg,What is Whey Protein?,"Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.
