While physical energy is obviously important in the gym, mental fatigue can wear you out faster than any cardio program. Compounds such as caffeine and glucuronolactone are clinically proven to boost mental focus.The Enduropump Complex contains a proprietary blend of scientifically proven compounds for the best workout and muscular pumps EVER: L-Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced in the body for fat oxidation at the cellular level. Carnitine a so boosts the vascularity of your muscles to help get more oxidized blood through your system. Increased vascularity not only provides much-needed oxygen for energy production, but also gives you a lovely post-workout pump. By providing your cells with more fuel, your muscles will be able to work longer and harder before entering a catabolic state. Preventing muscle breakdown allows for your body’s hormonal receptors to bind with anabolic hormones, resulting in more muscle growth. Citrulline is a relatively new ingredient in the sports supplement game, but arguably the most exciting. Citrulline metabolizes into nitric oxide in your body. It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels. Nitric oxide reduces the amount of oxygen needed in muscle tissue during exercise. Less oxygen consumption translates into boosted power and endurance levels – so you can get the most out of your workout. Beta Alanine is essential to the production of carnosine, a key component of muscle tissue. Carnosine is used quickly during intense exercise, resulting in sore muscles from lactic acid build up as a result of muscle breakdown. Beta Alanine supplementation keeps carnosine levels elevated, ultimately resulting in less muscle breakdown during exercise and significantly improved muscle endurance. This is particularly important to anaerobic exercises like interval training and heavy weight training. Betaine anhydrous, found in beetroot juice, improved muscular force and endurance in athletes undergoing intense anaerobic exercise in several performance studies. Additionally, it is a powerful antioxidant.

They can be added to any training and nutrition program, but are particularly beneficial to beginners and serious athletes. Orange TRIad offers complete multivitamin support, as well as joint, immune and digestion complexes for protection from overuse and illness. The Digestion and Immune Complex includes natural anti-inflammatories and digestive aids to keep your body functioning properly at all levels. Ginger root extract is commonly used to treat stomach discomfort, indigestion and bloating, as well as touting anti-inflammatory properties. Echinacea is recommended to both prevent and treat existing illness as a powerful immune booster. Knotweed root extract is a powerful herbal medicine used to treat everything from sore throat to skin disorders. Glucosamine is a naturally occurring chemical compound found in the human body. As we age, glucosamine levels drop significantly in our systems, contributing to the loss of natural cartilage and subsequent joint pain. Supplementation of glucosamine has been used for years to treat joint pain, stiffness and osteoporosis. While glucosamine supplementation will not prevent injury, it has been shown to aid in recovery of joint damage by encouraging the synthesis of connective tissues. Chondroitin, (similar to glucosamine) is also a naturally occurring substance that decreases as we age. Test subjects in studies on the effects of chondroitin supplementation suffered less joint pain and required fewer painkillers than the placebo groups. MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) is an important element of joint supplementation as it hinders the causes of joint pain and inflammation. MSM provides vital building blocks of not only joints and cartilage, but is also essential in the growth of skin, hair, nails, and supporting various biochemical bodily processes. Hyaluronic Acid is a less common but extremely effective joint supplement as it helps your body produce the synovial fluid needed to lubricate your joints (think oiling a squeaky wheel) and assists in the formation of the collagen your body uses in connective tissues.",Controlled Labs Orange TRIad 270 tabs ,Buy Controlled Labs Orange TRIad 270 tabs from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Controlled Labs/Orange TRIad,,,Health Supplement,"Improve health, joint support",Controlled Labs,Orange TRIad,270 tabs

B vitamins provide additional energy without a crash, and the components of the HyperCRE and HyperBulge Complexes boost your strength and stamina. B vitamins play a crucial role in cell metabolism, and as such are a common deficiency in athletes. B vitamin deficiency results in significant mental and physical fatigue. Supplementation with B6 encourages amino acid metabolism – particularly of neurotransmitters. B12 is heavily involved in the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats – essential for energy production. The HyperCRE complex features a potent combination of patented Magnesium Creatine Chelate and 2CM (Dicreatine Malate), beneficial during both anaerobic and aerobic workouts and involved in the efficient production and utilization of ATP. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contraction (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). Creatine binds with the by-product of ATP usage, a substance called adenosine di-phosphate (ADP). In order to build more ATP to replenish your body’s energy stores, ADP uses the phosphate molecule bound to creatine to create more ATP. The curcumin in Green Bulge’s HyperBulge complex is sourced from turmeric. Clinical trials on the effects of curcumin demonstrate impressive anti-inflammatory properties, particularly with relation to joint health.

Along with a precisely dosed amount of betaine, taurine and tyrosine for improved mental focus and positive vascular effects. Ingestion of creatine in conjunction with your workout replenishes energy stores and encourages muscular water retention – helping you achieve the muscular pump you love to see after a hard training session. Not only do fuller muscles look and feel better, but the added water retention will actually speed up your recovery time by helping keep you hydrated. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine. Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout. Your muscles utilise adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) as a delivery system for energy to muscle cells to force a muscle contraction. The by-product of this process is adenosine di-phosphate, which stays rather useless in your system until it has a chance to bind with the phosphate molecule in creatine and reform into ATP. Unfortunately, your body doesn’t create creatine quickly or in large quantities, making creatine supplementation all but necessary serious athletes.

In laboratory studies, betaine anhydrous significantly improved muscular force and endurance in athletes undergoing intense anaerobic exercise.

GlycerGrow combines a proprietary and synergistic blend of pharmaceutical grade ingredients to increase cell volume, aid the beneficial effects of creatine, and enhance the natural anabolic (muscle building) responses of weightlifting. Simply put, it is the most advanced standalone cell volumisation breakthrough yet. Glycerol is a naturally occurring substance in the human body. It works by increasing the concentration of fluid in blood and tissues – also known as a muscular pump. In laymen’s terms, taking glycerol in supplemental form quickly improves hydration and the absorption of other supplements that are taken with it. The end result is faster delivery of nutrients when and where you need them the most and the prolonged “pump effect” during your workouts. Glycerol MonoStearate is glycerol esterified with a stearic acid. This compound absorbs water from the air, so keep this container tightly closed at all times. Glycerol is a carbohydrate and stearic acid is a saturated fatty acid, when you combine them you get a fat called Glycerol Monostearate.

Ingestion of creatine in conjunction with your workout replenishes energy stores and encourages muscular water retention – helping you achieve the muscular pump you love to see after a hard training session. Not only do fuller muscles look and feel better, but the added water retention will actually speed up your recovery time by helping keep you hydrated. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine.

CLA is a potent supplement with numerous health benefits, most notably for increasing lean muscle mass whilst simultaneously promoting body fat loss. CLA is found naturally in certain protein sources such as red meat, eggs, and high-fat dairy. Unfortunately, modern diets and farming practices have reduced the amount of naturally occurring CLA so much so that athletes are almost guaranteed to require CLA supplementation. Controlled Labs CLAmore encourages usage of your body’s existing fat stores for energy whilst preventing the formation of new fat cells. Scientific studies also suggest that CLA is an effective antioxidant and anti-carcinogen. A double-blind study on the effects of CLA supplementation in athletes found that CLA not only promoted fat loss, but encouraged lean muscle growth – with no other changes to exercise or diet plans! Participants took CLA 3 three times daily and lost significantly more body fat than their counterparts on placebos. By using stored fat as an energy source, your body’s metabolic rate will increase as a result of lean muscle growth. It’s a completely beneficial cycle of lean muscle increase resulting in higher metabolic rates resulting in burning more stored fat, which results in more lean muscle mass. CLA has been shown to actually prevent the formation of new fat cells, therefore helping regulate body fat levels. Medically, CLA is used to help regulate high blood pressure, cholesterol, aid in weight loss, and even limit reactions to food allergies.

Blue UP uses laboratory-test proven ingredients that raise overall testosterone levels and encourage increases in free (or unbound) testosterone. Free testosterone is what your muscles need to properly grow and build strength. Most testosterone supplements encourage the rise of total testosterone levels whilst ignoring free testosterone levels. Controlled Labs Blue UP addresses both of these issues at the same time. The powerful natural extracts in Controlled Labs Blue UP will ignite your body’s own mechanisms for unbinding testosterone so you can finally see the gains and energy you’ve always wanted. Controlled Labs Blue UP uses a blend of natural plant extracts to boost your total testosterone, free up bound testosterone, and give you extra energy and focus to maximize your workout performance. Tribulus Terrestris is a Mediterranean plant that has been used for centuries in herbal medicine. When harvested after flowering but before hardening into fruit, Tribulus Terrestris yields a powerful substance known as steroidal saponin protodioscin. Saponin works by increasing your body’s luteinizing hormone – the hormone that signals testosterone production in your system. After Tribulus Terrestris signals your body to produce more testosterone, Controlled Labs Blue UP provides you with Avena Sativa to unbind the testosterone so your muscles can better use them. Avena Sativa, found here in the highest standard grade available, works on the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) to break apart the testosterone bound to it. LongJack (Eurycoma Longifolia) is laboratory proven to boost the average male serum testosterone levels by 100% in just 14 days. LongJack helps regulate cortisol levels (which can increase body fat when elevated) and boost overall IGF1 levels. Additionally, LongJack inhibits SHBG from binding with excess testosterone – which can lead to an increase in estrogen levels. For added energy to pump your workouts in the gym, Controlled Labs Blue UP uses caffeine derived from herbal sources and 6.5 mg of yohimbine – the active ingredient in yohimbe. This powerful vasodilator allows for more oxygenated blood and free testosterone to flow through your muscles whilst working out. Combined with caffeine, you’ll also experience intense concentration to focus your energy.",Controlled Labs Blue UP 60 caps ,Buy Controlled Labs Blue UP 60 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Controlled Labs/Blue UP,,,"Testosterone Booster, Sport supplement","Improve health, build muscle, improve workout",Controlled Labs,Blue UP,60 caps

With Blue GrowtH, you’ll sleep better than ever and experience a multitude of benefits associated with actual HGH supplementation. Safed Musli comes from a rare herb from the tropical forests of India. Most commonly chewed in leaf form as a medicinal aphrodisiac, its components are said to mirror the effects of testosterone in the human body. Mucuna Pruriens is a great source of L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine. Supplementation with Mucuna Pruriens has been shown to effectively increase dopamine and circulating growth hormone levels within hours of ingestion. L-Carnitine, found in Blue GrowtH’s SleepCycle Health Complex, is an amino acid naturally produced by the body for fat oxidation in cells. L-Carnitine-L-Tartrate is L-Carnitine combined with an organic compound (tartaric acid) to boost absorption at the cellular level. LCLT aids in energy production by transporting the body’s natural fuel – fat – to the mitochondria of the cell for energy production. LCLT also boosts the vascularity of your muscles to help get more oxidized blood through your system. Increased vascularity not only provides much-needed oxygen for energy production, but also gives you a lovely post-workout pump. By providing your cells with more fuel, your muscles will be able to work longer and harder before entering a catabolic state. Preventing muscle breakdown allows for your body’s hormonal receptors to bind with anabolic hormones, resulting in more muscle growth.",Controlled Labs Blue GrowtH 150 caps ,Buy Controlled Labs Blue GrowtH 150 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Controlled Labs/Blue GrowtH,,,"Testosterone Booster, Sport supplement, health supplement","Improve health, build muscle, improve workout",Controlled Labs,Blue GrowtH,150 caps

Insulin supports amino acid uptake into the muscles, boosting your energy levels and helping you recover quickly. Three key BCAAs comprise approximately 1/3 of your muscle’s composition: Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine. Ideal BCAA mixtures are comprised of at least 40% Leucine. NRGFuel’s BCAA mixture is 50% leucine. This will encourage the best lean muscle growth possible.Amino acids are the core building block for protein. They are essential to muscle recovery and energy output. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild.All of this works in tandem with the structure of BCAAs to improve protein synthesis – some studies indicated an increase of nearly 150% when BCAAs are ingested during/after strength training.Proper exercise is a uniquely executed type of muscle damage. By promoting lipid (fat) oxidation for energy and improving blood glucose levels during exercise, BCAAs ultimately prevent muscle fatigue and breakdown. Less muscle fatigue translates into your ability to get an extra mile in, or one more set at the end of your workout. Less muscle breakdown translates into less lactic acid build-up in your muscles – so you’ll recover faster and see more intense lean muscle growth.",NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel BCAA 120 caps ,Buy NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel BCAA 120 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/NRG Fuel Fuel/NRGFuel BCAA,,,"BCAA, Amino Acid Supplement, sports supplement","Improve sports, improve workout, build muscle, recovery",NRG Fuel Fuel,NRGFuel BCAA,120 caps

NRGFuel Diet Power is the solution to bad tasting, incomplete meal replacement powders. NRGFuel Diet Power is packed with superfood elements, vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and amino acids to help build lean muscle. The primary ingredient in NRGFuel Diet Power is palintose, a low-GI complex carbohydrate that gives you sustained energy without wreaking havoc on your blood sugar and insulin levels. It is considered one of the best carbohydrates sources for athletes. Whey protein is considered the most studied and beneficial protein supplements. It has a wide range of amino acids – the building blocks of any protein – and is known to help boost muscle strength, lean muscle mass and support body fat loss. The amino acids in whey protein help boost your endurance while working out – particularly Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs – and hinder muscle breakdown following exercise. The less muscle breakdown you incur while exercising, the less lactic acid build up your muscles will have, resulting in significantly shorter recovery times. NRGFuel Diet Power’s protein blend is high in the essential amino acid leucine. Leucine is a key building block for healthy, lean muscle. It also helps prevent the loss of muscle tissue following exercise. By keeping healthy, lean muscle tissue your body increase its metabolic rate to keep that muscle fed – leading to a loss of body fat. Hydrolyzed collagen and Omega-3 have been added to NRGFuel Diet Power to boost your joint health, as well as improve your hair and skin health. Combined with vitamin k2-7, your body will feel better than ever with stronger bones and healthier joints. Last but not least, the superfood and vitamin blend in NRGFuel Diet Power is perhaps the most beneficial aspect of this meal replacement. The powers of L-carnitine, great tea and chromium have been touted for centuries to maintain a healthy weight and encourage overall wellness. Vitamins C, E, and selenium will boost your immune system and help you feel like the best version of you whilst you decrease your waistline.",NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel Diet Power 700g ,Buy NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel Diet Power 700g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/NRG Fuel Fuel/NRGFuel Diet Power,,,"All in one, protein","Improve health, improve sports, increase energy, lose fat",NRG Fuel Fuel,NRGFuel Diet Power,700g

With 5g of pure creatine monohydrate per serving, you’ll look better, feel better, and your body will begin to perform as never before. In simple terms: Simply creatine improves your body’s ability to quickly produce muscle-contracting and rapidly recover from training. Ingestion of creatine post-workout replenishes energy stores and encourages muscular water retention – helping you achieve the muscular pump you love to see after a hard training session. Not only do fuller muscles look and feel better, but the added water retention will actually speed up your recovery time by helping keep you hydrated. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine. Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout. Your muscles utilize adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) as a delivery system for energy to muscle cells to force a muscle contraction. The by-product of this process is adenosine di-phosphate, which stays rather useless in your system until it has a chance to bind with the phosphate molecule in creatine and reform into ATP. Unfortunately, your body doesn’t create creatine quickly or in large quantities, making creatine supplementation all but necessary serious athletes.",NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel Creatine Monohydrate 600g ,Buy NRG Fuel Fuel NRGFuel Creatine Monohydrate 600g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/NRG Fuel Fuel/NRGFuel Creatine Monohydrate,,,"Creatine, sports supplements","Improve workout, recovery, improve sports, build muscle",NRG Fuel Fuel,NRGFuel Creatine Monohydrate,600g

NRGFuels Anabolic Whey’s muscle-building formula includes D Aspartic Acid to naturally boost your testosterone levels in a high-protein, low fat and low carb formula to keep your macronutrients on track. Did we mention it tastes great too? NRGFuel Anabolic Whey isn’t just a protein powder. In addition to D-Aspartic Acid, NRGFuel Anabolic Whey contains glutamine, BCAAs and creatine for a complete supplementation profile to help you reach your fitness goals. D-Aspartic Acid (D-AA) is a form of amino acid widely used as a testosterone booster. It works by causing the brain to release luteinizing, follicle-stimulating, and growth hormones. When your body’s own D-AA levels begin to drop, you can experience fatigue, decreased stamina, and even feel the effects on your libido. Supplementing with quality D-AA on a regular basis helps combat these negative effects by helping your body produce more of its own testosterone. Whey protein contains a naturally high amount of amino acids – the building blocks of protein and an essential element of muscle recovery and growth. The amino acids in whey protein boost muscle endurance while working out and aid muscle growth following exercise. Glutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles. Creatine is a must-have supplement for any serious athlete. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contraction. Following a heavy workout, your body’s ATP stores work overtime to replenish themselves – using creatine to get there. Creatine increases the body’s ability to build ATP. When you’re muscles are full-up on ATP stores, you can contract harder, lifting heavier and building muscle faster.",NRG Fuel Fuel NRGfuel Anabolic Whey 2kg ,Buy NRG Fuel Fuel NRGfuel Anabolic Whey 2kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/NRG Fuel Fuel/NRGfuel Anabolic Whey,,,"protein, mass gain, sports supplement","build muscle, gain mass, improve workout, improve sport",NRG Fuel Fuel,NRGfuel Anabolic Whey,2kg

Complex carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores without causing an insulin crash. Two different forms of creatine feed your muscles to help you recover faster and bring it harder tomorrow in the gym. Quality protein blend encourages muscle growth, especially when combined with the type of carbohydrates in NutriSport Protein + Carbs. During exercise, your body depletes glycogen stores for energy, uses ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for constant and quick muscle contractions, and temporarily lowers the body’s immune system. To properly refuel and recover to hit the gym again tomorrow, your body needs a carefully balanced and effective food source. Researchers found that combining protein with carbohydrates results in exponentially higher muscle glycogen synthesis. NutriSport Protein + Carbs gives you simple and complex carbohydrates combined with a quality protein source to refill your glycogen stores and jumpstart muscle growth and fat burning. Your body’s muscles are made of approximately 1/3rd amino acids. They need creatine to function properly. Small amounts of creatine are naturally created by your body after eating, but today’s diets rarely give us the creatine required to meet the demanding needs of a high-level fitness lifestyle. This is particularly true for the modern athlete – whether you’re a professional bodybuilder, or even a beginner in the gym.

As a result, Boditronics Express Whey is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market.  What is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.Boditronics Express Whey is an extremely well-rounded product in that it contains more than just a simple whey protein.  There are two types of whey – concentrate and isolate – to feed your muscles properly in a post-workout anabolic window; a casein protein to keep your muscles fed for up to 7 hours after ingestion; glutamine peptides for muscle growth, MCT oil, and a prebiotic blend to support proper digestion. Boditronics Express Whey contains no artificial colours, flavours, or preservatives.Whey concentrate and isolate feed your muscles with quick-absorbing protein while casein protein gels in your stomach to provide you with extended release protein. Whey concentrate is the least processed, and therefore most complete, type of whey protein.  It provides a full array of amino acids and peptides.  Whey isolate is the most easily digestible type of whey, and is perfect for pre- and post-workout supplementation.Casein is the ideal slow-digesting protein, particularly before your body enters a fasting state – such as while you sleep.  The reason casein takes so long to digest is that casein forms a gel-like consistency ball in your stomach. This bundle of protein takes time to break down, which means you’re getting a naturally controlled-release food source.By providing three types of protein, Boditronics Express Whey is providing your body with a complete amino acid profile. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.Glutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes.  Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the aminos found Boditronics Express Whey).MCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides, and occurs naturally in foods like coconut oil. Studied on the effects of MCT oil supplementation show participants lose more body fat, increase their metabolisms and indicate feeling more full overall with less cravings. When MCT oil is digested, it acts more like a carbohydrate than a fat – giving you energy but not storing as fat.Finally, the prebiotic blend in Boditronics Express Whey ensures the best digestion and absorption possible for a protein powder. Prebiotics are proven in clinical studies to improve nutrient absorption, support immune system, increase “good” bacteria and decrease “bad” bacteria throughout the intestines, and are highly correlated with healthy body weight and appetite control.  ",Boditronics Express Whey 900g / 2kg ,Buy Boditronics Express Whey 900g / 2kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Express Whey,,,,,Boditronics,Express Whey,900g / 2kg
1083,Express Whey Anabolic,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,Whey Concentrate|Creatine|D-Aspartic Acid,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Express Whey Anabolic is a truly unique, and exciting, muscle-building formula.  By combining clinically proven anabolic ingredients in just the right amounts, this protein powder is the optimal formula for growth and recovery. Whey concentrate is combine with glutamine, a Di-Creatine Complex, and (for the first time!) research-proven D-Aspartic acid. The end result is a high protein, low fat, low carb anabolic growth supplement. Best of all, it has a fantastic taste. The anabolic protein blend in Boditronics Express Whey Anaobolic combines the quick-absorbing effects of whey concentrate with energy-supporting powers of glutamine. Whey concentrate is the most popular type of protein in the supplement world for good reason: it is the least processed, most complete type of protein available. Less processing equals more amino acids and peptides for muscle growth and recovery.  As whey protein is quick to digest, it is ideal for post-workout recovery. The anabolic (muscle-building) effects are doubled when combined with glutamine.  Glutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growth. Glutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate). The Di-Creatine complex is a unique blend of creatine monohydrate and creatine gluconate. Since each type metabolizes differently, using more than one kind of creatine ensures maximum impact from creatine supplementation. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. Creatine also helps give your muscles a lovely post-workout pump, since it causes your muscles to retain water. So how does each type work?Creatine monohydrate is the most effective form of creatine, according to performance studies. Its chemical structure doesn’t require a loading period (as most creatines do) before the beneficial effects kick in.  However, since it is not water soluble creatine monohydrate must be ingested quickly to avoid denaturing.Creatine gluconate is relatively new to the supplement world – but it is one of the more exciting developments yet. As most types of creatine are digested in the stomach, not all of it reaches muscle tissue where it is most needed.  Creatine gluconate “games the system” since it is bonded with a glucose molecule.  The glucose molecule causes your stomach to treat it as a simple carbohydrate, so it is digested before the stomach has the opportunity to bind the creatine with water and hang around for a while.  D-Aspartic Acid is perhaps the most exciting part of Boditronics Express Whey Anabolic. D-aspartic acid is an amino acid that stimulate the release of LH (luteinizing hormone), a precursor to testosterone.  Studies back the efficacy of d-aspartic acid with increases as high as 30-50% more testosterone compared with a placebo group. Testosterone levels are directly correlated with strength, endurance levels, and the ability to grow muscle – making D-Aspartic Acid a perfect addition to this anabolic protein supplement.",Boditronics Express Whey Anabolic 2kg ,Buy Boditronics Express Whey Anabolic 2kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Express Whey Anabolic,,,,,Boditronics,Express Whey Anabolic,2kg

What is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.  By using 4 different kinds of protein from different nutritional sources, Boditronics Express Protein XTR-4 provides you with what is quite possibly the most complete and effective protein powder on the market in terms of amino acid profile, peptides, vitamins, and minerals.  To make it a proper supplement, Boditronics added glutamine to help you meet your fitness goals. Depending on your dietary goals, you should aim to consume somewhere between 0.8g – 1.5g of protein for every pound of body weight.  For less active individuals, the amount should be closer to half a gram.  More active athletes need to consume 1g per lb of bodyweight daily – or more, depending on your activity level. For example, an active individual weighing 10 stone (or 140 lbs) should aim for around 140 grams of protein daily.   The whey protein concentrate Boditronics uses is processed using specific kind of cold press to prevent denatured proteins and amino acids.  As a result, Boditronics whey protein is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market. Whey concentrate is the least processed, and therefore most complete, type of whey protein.  It provides a full array of amino acids and peptides.  Casein is the ideal slow-digesting protein, particularly before your body enters a fasting state – such as while you sleep.  The reason casein takes so long to digest is that casein forms a gel-like consistency ball in your stomach. This bundle of protein takes time to break down, which means you’re getting a naturally controlled-release food source. The addition of casein ensures that your body is being fed a steady stream of nutrients for hours after ingestion.Egg albumin is an incredible protein source that is not utilized nearly as much as it should be.  Egg Protein is made from a process that involved separating the yolks from the white and dehydrating the whites.  It is very protein dense, providing approximately 4 times the amount found in one egg in per serving.  Eggs are also naturally high in vitamins and minerals.The inclusion of soy protein provides a lovely multivitamin support profile. Plant proteins, and soy in particular, are becoming increasingly popular in the supplement world. Plant proteins are naturally high in fiber and don’t often need the same artificial flavouring that other protein sources use. Soy isolate is used here. Isolate is the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but often lacking in complete amino profiles offered by concentrate. Boditronics has combined plant and animal-based proteins here to give the most complete nutritional profile, since they offer a different range of amino acids and vitamins.  Boditronics Express Protein XTR-4 also includes prebiotic inulin as a source of fiber.  Inulin, along with other dietary fiber, has been suggested to promote regularity. Scientists have suggested that inulin and other fibers have potential health benefits that include improving or maintaining colon health as a prebiotic, increasing the absorption of minerals, particularly calcium, and improving immune function.Last but not least: glutamine! Glutamine is the most common amino acid in the human body – which means it is heavily utilized in bodily functions. As a result, the odds of a serious athlete needing to supplement for optimal performance is extremely high. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it bonds with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles. ",Boditronics Express Protein XTR-4 800g/2kg/4kg ,Buy Boditronics Express Protein XTR-4 800g/2kg/4kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Express Protein XTR-4,,,,,Boditronics,Express Protein XTR-4,800g/2kg/4kg

1088,Casein Xtra,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,Casein|HMB|Glutamine,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"The casein protein blend in Boditronics Casein Xtra was specially designed to be consumed prior to sleep, but is also perfect for fasts or before/during an endurance event to provide your muscles with a continual supply of amino acids and energy.  This is further supported by the addition of HMB and Glutamine.Protein is comprised of amino acids – another supplement often found on its own.  Your muscles are made of amino acids (as a foundation) and use amino acids to build and repair, as well as fuel bodily functions.  Amino acids are also important building blocks for healthy skin, hair, nails and bone density.   Therefore, individuals that don’t get enough protein in their diets often find that their overall health and appearance will suffer, even if they are otherwise healthy.Casein protein has a different amino acid profile than whey, and is very slowly digested – for a natural time-released effect. Casein forms a gel-like substance in your stomach after ingestion, so your body takes much longer to process it than whey.  This translates into a very steady stream of amino acids over a long period of time (usually 7 hours or so).Amino acids are the core building block for protein.  They are essential to muscle recovery and energy output.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild.   All of this works in tandem with the structure of BCAAs to improve protein synthesis – some studies indicated an increase of nearly 150% when BCAAs are ingested during/after strength training.HMB stands for beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid.  In simple terms, it is a metabolite (after product) of the essential amino acid leucine. It is found naturally found in certain foods such as grapefruit and catfish, but is by no means abundant in the everyday diet.  Studies on the effect of HMB supplementation show increases in lean muscle mass and overall strength and size.  HMB works by suppressing catabolic (muscle breakdown) processes, and boosting protein synthesis to encourage muscle growth. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. In fact, Glutamine is so effective in treating muscle damage (what you feel when you’re muscles are sore after exercise) that it is used medically to help improve healing after traumatic injuries and even helps prevent infections.  ",Boditronics Casein Xtra 1.5kg ,Buy Boditronics Casein Xtra 1.5kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Casein Xtra,,,,,Boditronics,Casein Xtra,1.5kg

For less active individuals, the amount should be closer to half a gram.  More active athletes need to consume 1g per lb of bodyweight daily – or more, depending on your activity level. For example, an active individual weighing 10 stone (or 140 lbs) should aim for around 140 grams of protein daily.  Profusion Reloaded contains the highest amount of bioavailable protein per serving than ANY other all-in-one supplement.  By using a blend of high-quality proteins, your body won’t be lacking for amino acids or peptides.  Boditronics Profusion reloaded contains both whey concentrate and whey isolate.  Each has its own benefits: Whey is often considered the ideal fast-acting protein since it is so easily absorbed – perfect for post-workout replenishment and growth.  Whey protein is particularly high in essential amino acids – essential meaning the ones your body doesn’t produce and needs to get from food to function properly. Whey concentrate is the least processed and generally the most complete in terms of amino acids and peptides. Whey Isolate is the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but often lacking in complete amino profiles offered by concentrate.Now on to the rest of the goodies in this incredible supplement: Bodipure Creatine, beta alanine, glutamine, and taurine.Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contraction (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). Creatine binds with the by-product of ATP usage, a substance called adenosine di-phosphate (ADP).  In order to build more ATP to replenish your body’s energy stores, ADP uses the phosphate molecule bound to creatine to create more ATP.  BodiPure Creatine is lab tested for 100% purity with no contaminates. Pure creatine ensures the best possible product for your muscles, meaning you get the best possible results from your training routine. BodiPure Creatine is absorbed best when combined with a carbohydrate – and Boditronics Profusion Reloaded has you covered with 19g of carbs with their Carbohydrate Sustained Energy Blend.Beta Alanine is an amino acid proven to increase exercise performance and endurance. Clinical studies on the effects of beta alanine supplementation demonstrate significant increases in overall performance and endurance levels, as well as decreased muscle soreness. Profusion Reloaded provides you with 2000mg of Beta Alanine for maximum recovery and performance.3000mg of Glutamine peptides helps you fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. In fact, Glutamine is so effective in treating muscle damage (what you feel when you’re muscles are sore after exercise) that it is used medically to help improve healing after traumatic injuries and even helps prevent infections.  Glutamine and taurine both help your muscles obtain that lovely post-workout pump by increasing muscle cell volumization.  Taurine also helps give you an energy boost and improves focus – which is why it is so popular in energy drinks.Finally, Boditronics Profusion reloaded is rounded out with 9 vitamins and minerals to help keep you hydrated, healthy, and ready to hit your training with the same focus and energy every day.",Boditronics Profusion Reloaded 2kg ,Buy Boditronics Profusion Reloaded 2kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Profusion Reloaded,,,,,Boditronics,Profusion Reloaded,2kg
1090,Mass Attack EVO,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,UltraCarb Blend|Protein Blend|Glutamine Peptides,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Mass Attack EVO takes a revolutionary approach to mass gain supplements by providing a blend of proven, muscle-building ingredients instead of the run-of-the-mill powdered carbohydrates that comprises other “mass gainers”. A mass gainer with just carbohydrates will help you put on mass – but the problem is the extra “mass” will likely be fat, since excess high glycemic load carbohydrates almost always convert to fat.Boditronics Mass Attack EVO gives you a massive 40g of protein per serving from 3 different protein sources, along with 60g of low-glycemic load carbohydrates from their unique Ultra Carbohydrate Blend. When combined with glutamine and MCTs, this mass gainer is basically a one-stop-shop for anyone wanting to gain lean muscle without a layer of fat most mass gainers result in. First: the proteins. Boditronics Mass Attack EVO uses three types of protein for a truly amino acid-rich time release blend. Boditronics uses a specific kind of cold press to prevent denatured proteins and amino acids.  As a result, the whey concentrate in Mass Attack EVO is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market.  What is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.Whey concentrate feeds your muscles with quick-absorbing protein while casein protein gels in your stomach to provide you with extended release protein. Whey concentrate is the least processed, and therefore most complete, type of whey protein.  It provides a full array of amino acids and peptides.  Casein is the ideal slow-digesting protein, particularly before your body enters a fasting state – such as while you sleep.  The reason casein takes so long to digest is that casein forms a gel-like consistency ball in your stomach. This bundle of protein takes time to break down, which means you’re getting a naturally controlled-release food source.The third protein source is a soy isolate.  Soy protein is naturally high in fiber – necessary for proper digestion in high-protein diets. The important part is the isolate: isolates are the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight. The UltraCarb Blend in Boditronics Mass Attack EVO was formulated as a 4 stage low glycemic load featuring Ground Whole Oats, Barley Malt, Whole Durum Wheat and Waxy Maize Starch. This blend is particularly high in vitamins, minerals and overall nutrient content – all but replacing parts of the typical multivitamin.  By using low-glycemic load sources, your body is getting a contant stream of slow-digesting energy that encourages muscle growth instead of fat storage.  Glutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growth. Glutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate).Completing the nutritional profile in Boditronics Mass Attack EVO is the addition of MCT to boost metabolism.  MCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides, and occurs naturally in foods like coconut oil.  When MCT oil is digested, it acts more like a carbohydrate than a fat – giving you energy but not storing as fat.  Due to their structure, they don’t follow the usual digestive channels for fat.  And since they aren’t actually carbohydrates, your body won’t trigger an insulin response in an attempt to put it into fat storage.",Boditronics Mass Attack EVO 2.5kg / 4kg ,Buy Boditronics Mass Attack EVO 2.5kg / 4kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Mass Attack EVO,,,,,Boditronics,Mass Attack EVO,2.5kg / 4kg
1091,Mass Attack Heavyweight,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,Not Done,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight is the literal heavyweight of the Mass Attack line. Designed specifically for “hardgainers” (those who have a hard time gaining and maintaining weight due to their sky-high metabolisms), one serving provides a massive 71 grams of high-quality protein and 220 grams of carbohydrates.  The Heavyweight blend also includes a Heavyweight Gain Stack of creatine and dextrose monohydrate to create the optimal muscle-building environment.Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight uses two types of protein for a truly amino acid-rich blend. Boditronics uses a specific kind of cold press to prevent denatured proteins and amino acids.  As a result, the whey concentrate in Mass Attack Heavyweight is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market.  What is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.Unlike most mass gain supplements, the carbohydrate Ultimate Energy Blend in Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight isn’t straight simple sugars. While the maltodextrin provides the quick energy you’d expect, the addition of whole grain oats and MCTs gives you a steady, low-glycemic load energy source to power you for hours.  Whole grain oats are a wonderful source of nutrients, and since they don’t digest super fast there’s no big insulin spike. MCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides, and occurs naturally in foods like coconut oil.  When MCT oil is digested, it acts more like a carbohydrate than a fat – giving you energy but not storing as fat.  Due to their structure, they don’t follow the usual digestive channels for fat.  And since they aren’t actually carbohydrates, your body won’t trigger an insulin response in an attempt to put it into fat storage.The Heavyweight Gain Stack in this product is particularly exciting.  Creatine is extremely well-known and loved for its muscle-promoting properties. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. By combining creatine with the dextrose molecule, Bodiitronics Mass Attack Heavyweight encourages rapid absorption of creatine into the bloodstream.",Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight 6kg ,Buy Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight 6kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Mass Attack Heavyweight,,,,,Boditronics,Mass Attack Heavyweight,6kg
1092,BodiPure Glutamine,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,100% Pure Glutamine,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Bodipure Glutamine to aid muscle recovery following tough workouts.  Bodipure Glutamine is micronized for rapid absorption into your bloodstream – as quickly as 30 minutes after ingestion.Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body.  Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids).  For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial.  Glutamine is considered a non-essential amino acid. Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that, most of the time, they do not need to be supplemented by your diet.  That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly.  For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids are often reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile.Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes.  Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical.  This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels.  When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs.The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles.  They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss.  Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancerGlutamine is by far the most common amino acid in the human body.  As such, the body relies heavily on it for countless bodily processes.  The more stress you place your body under, especially with physical exertion, the faster you’ll use up your glutamine stores.Glutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes.  Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as aminos found in any BCAA supplement or protein source).Glutamine is so effective in treating muscle damage (what you feel when you’re muscles are sore after exercise) that it is used medically to help improve healing after traumatic injuries and even helps prevent infections.Supplementation with Boditronics Bodipure Glutamine will help ensure your body’s immune system remains strong and decrease healing times following the tough exercises – especially when taken immediately following a workout.",Boditronics BodiPure Glutamine 500g ,Buy Boditronics BodiPure Glutamine 500g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/BodiPure Glutamine,,,,,Boditronics,BodiPure Glutamine,500g
1093,Red Mist V2,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,Taurine|Creatine HCL|Beta Alanine,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Red Mist V2 is possibly the most comprehensive, effective, and well-formulated pre-workout on the market. Period.Red Mist V2 gives you intense focus and energy, but without overloading you with stimulants.  This supplement will help you push harder in the gym, lift heavier, go longer, build more muscle mass, and provide intense post-workout pumps.  Here’s how:Creatine HCL (hydrochloride) is the newest form of creatine available. It gives all of the same effects of other types of creatine with a smaller doses, and with less stomach discomfort.  This will replenish and build energy stores in your muscles, and you should start seeing a notable difference in you exercise endurance, strength level, and overall recovery times.Beta-alanine is primarily intended for athletes who are constantly using the same muscles, without the ability to take a break and recover for a few days. The effects of creatine plus beta-alanine on strength, power, body composition, and endocrine changes were examined during a 10-week resistance-training program in collegiate athletes. Results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of creatine plus beta-alanine on strength performance. Creatine plus beta-alanine supplementation appeared to have the greatest effect on lean tissue accruement and body fat compositionCitrulline malate helps to recycle l-argenine through your system for extra energy, removing ammonia at the same time to help lower the acidic environment created by intense training. Citrulline metabolizes into nitric oxide in your body.  It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels. Nitric oxide reduces the amount of oxygen needed in muscle tissue during exercise.  Less oxygen consumption translates into boosted power and endurance levels – so you can get the most out of your workout.Arginine is used in fat metabolism, release of growth hormones, fighting free radicals (antioxidant effect), and protein synthesis (precursor to muscle growth).When arginine is metabolized, it is converted into nitric oxide – thus making it one of the best ways to increase nitric oxide levels in your system.  Athletes love the effect of nitric oxide for the extra energy it gives them.  It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels.Taurine is commonly found in energy drinks, as they it known for boosting mental alertness, fighting fatigue, improving your mood, and controlling your appetite. It contains natural caffeine and other phenolic-containing antioxidant compounds. Glucuronolactone, a metabolite of glucose, has extremely positive effects on mood and altertness. This will provide additional alertness in the gym and help regulate your glycogen – which translates into better performance and more overall energy.L-tyrosine is an amino acid that supports cognitive function that typically diminishes after physical and mental exhaustion.  Mental endurance plays a huge role in overall physical performance.  Tyrosine is popular in energy drinks for this reason.Last but not least: caffeine.  The go-to, most proven ingredient in the history of pre-workouts. Caffeine gives you the more immediate energy boost so you’re not waiting around for that energized feeling whilst enhancing your mental alertness to keep you focused on your goal.",Boditronics Red Mist V2 80g/320g/640g ,Buy Boditronics Red Mist V2 80g/320g/640g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Red Mist V2,,,,,Boditronics,Red Mist V2,80g/320g/640g

While most zinc and magnesium supplements are designed to supplement male hormones, this supplement was developed for all athletes, male and female alike, to encourage strength gains and shorten recovery time – testosterone is an important hormone for both genders to achieve optimal health.Zinc is a mineral essential to the function of all animal-based life, and is said to be one of the only treatments effective in shortening the length of colds and flus.  It does this by stimulating white blood cell production – the little army of infection fighting soldiers in your blood.Athletes are at particular risk for zinc deficiency, since exercise increases rate at which zinc is used up.  Since athletes tend to be more conscious of their diets, they can run even more of a risk by limiting the variety of foods they eat.  This often includes natural sources of zinc. When zinc levels are compromised, you can suffer from extreme fatigue, poor digestion, and loss of neuromuscular control.  Your appearance can suffer as well, since low zinc levels will affect your skin and hair health.Zinc, as a trace mineral with antioxidant properties, is clinically proven to increase testosterone and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1).  Conversely, studies where participants were asked to avoid zinc-containing foods for a few weeks saw dramatic drops in their overall testosterone levels. Zinc is necessary for the body to convert androstenedione into testosterone. Magnesium, like zinc, is necessary to keep testosterone and growth hormone levels healthy.  Men and women with low magnesium levels were found to have correspondingly low testosterone levels in several studies.  Those who supplemented their diets with magnesium have significantly higher levels of testosterone in similar studies.Vitamin B6 encourages amino acid metabolism – particularly of neurotransmitters, and is heavily correlated with mood and sleep patterns. A popular ingredient in energy drinks, B6 plays a key role in metabolizing protein and fat while converting carbs to sugar for energy.Copper amino acid chelate is often used in vitamin and mineral supplements to encourage absorption.  Copper in particular plays a critical role in the body by carrying oxygen in the blood, encouraging a healthy immune system.  Those with copper deficiencies are at higher risk for disease and infections. ",Boditronics ZincMagnesium Complex 90 caps ,Buy Boditronics ZincMagnesium Complex 90 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/ZincMagnesium Complex,,,,,Boditronics,ZincMagnesium Complex,90 caps

The active ingredient is furostanolic saponins. The saponins in fenugreek, known as Fenuside in this supplement, are known to boost testosterone and overall strength levels significantly in a few short weeks.Fenuside works by stimulating the hormonal precursors to testosterone.  This encourages your body to produce its own testosterone.  This is a much safer and more effective method than actual testosterone dosing.Testofen us backed by human clinical studies carried out by Gencor Pacific Inc in California . Boditronics TestoFenXT is unique in providing the same high-level daily dose of Fenugreek extract as used in these studies.Testosterone boosters, especially herb-based, have been around for millennia in traditional medicine.  Testosterone levels in men begin to decline around age 30.  In some cases, the decline can start early and be quite rapid. For most men, there is nothing worse than experiencing low testosterone levels.  There are multiple causes, most commonly: age, but the overall side effects are the same: less strength, lowered endurance, low sex drive, fatigue, weight gain, and even muscle loss.  Some men find it difficult to accept that they have low testosterone, or are afraid to find out whether or not they do.Natural testosterone boosters are a safer, more discreet alternative to anabolic steroid (prescription or otherwise).  Some of them are arguably more effective, without the side effects that come with the steroid.		Not suitable for children		If side effects occur discontinue use and consult a GP		For use by men only		Free from artificial colouring, preservatives and gluten		No added sugar	Not Suitable for Vegetarians",Boditronics TestoFenXT 60 caps ,Buy Boditronics TestoFenXT 60 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/TestoFenXT,,,,,Boditronics,TestoFenXT,60 caps

LH levels can increase well over 100% from D-aspartic acid supplementation.  Studies back the efficacy of d-aspartic acid with increases as high as 30-50% more testosterone compared with a placebo group. Testosterone levels in men begin to decline around age 30.  In some cases, the decline can start early and be quite rapid. For most men, there is nothing worse than experiencing low testosterone levels.  There are multiple causes, most commonly age, but the overall side effects are the same: less strength, lowered endurance, low sex drive, fatigue, weight gain, and even muscle loss.  Some men find it difficult to accept that they have low testosterone, or are afraid to find out whether or not they do.Natural testosterone boosters are a safer, more discreet, and arguably more effective alternative to anabolic steroid (prescription or otherwise).Testosterone levels are directly correlated with strength, endurance levels, and the ability to grow muscle – making D-Aspartic Acid a perfect addition for any athlete wanting to improve on the aforementioned areas.D-aspartic acid works by causing the brain to release luteinizing, follicle-stimulating, and growth hormones.  When your body’s own D-AA levels begin to drop, you can experience fatigue, decreased stamina, and even feel the effects on your libido.  Supplementing with quality D-AA on a regular basis helps combat these negative effects by helping your body produce more of its own testosterone.D-aspartic acid also improves overall protein synthesis, which is key to recovering after a workout.  Clinical studies back the effects of this powerful amino acid on recovery times – demonstrating faster muscle repair.  What this translates to, in addition to boosting natural testosterone levels, is you being able to reach your strength and fitness goals faster since your muscles will recover more quickly.",Boditronics D Aspartic Acid 80 caps ,Buy Boditronics D Aspartic Acid 80 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/D Aspartic Acid,,,,,Boditronics,D Aspartic Acid,80 caps

1099,Splash RecoverEX,75,,Not Done,,Y,75,To be done after Upload,Whey Protein Isolate|Glutamine |Leucine,?,Not Done,Not Done,Not Done,"Boditronics Splash RecoverEX is a game changer in the world of recovery drinks.  For one, all of its flavours are fruity and refreshing – unlike the standard milk-based recovery drink.  Secondly, it is a state-of-the-art formula containing just the right amount of clinically proven ingredients to revive your body after a satisfyingly punishing workout (or a light workout – the effects will be just as good either way).Boditronics Splash RecoverEX contains protein isolate, glutamine peptides, leucine, and a dose of phenylalanine. Following a workout, your muscles are in a catabolic, or muscle-wasting, state. By ingesting a fast acting and easily digestible protein like Boditronics Splash RecoverEX, your body quickly returns to an anabolic, or muscle-building, state. What’s more: whey protein isolate will help prevent muscle breakdown in the future – helping you recover and build muscle faster than before.  Here’s how it works:Depending on your dietary goals, you should aim to consume somewhere between 0.8g – 1.5g of protein for every pound of body weight.  For less active individuals, the amount should be closer to half a gram.  More active athletes need to consume 1g per lb of bodyweight daily – or more, depending on your activity level. For example, an active individual weighing 10 stone (or 140 lbs) should aim for around 140 grams of protein daily.Whey is often considered the ideal fast-acting protein since it is so easily absorbed – perfect for post-workout replenishment and growth.  Whey protein is particularly high in essential amino acids – essential meaning the ones your body doesn’t produce and needs to get from food to function properly. Whey Isolate is the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight – the highest concentration of the whey varietals.Glutamine is the most common amino acid in the human body – which means those under stress (physical, mental, ect…) likely need glutamin supplementation to perform at their best.  Glutamine peptides helps you fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. In fact, Glutamine is so effective in treating muscle damage (what you feel when you’re muscles are sore after exercise) that it is used medically to help improve healing after traumatic injuries and even helps prevent infections.Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population.  It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is vital to several healing processes throughout the body.  Leucine is a type of amino acid known as branched-chain. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise.  This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore.Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that the body cannot create on its own, and must be supplemented to support proper health and nutrition.  During exercise, phenylalanine is one of the most heavily released amino acids in the body – resulting in protein loss and muscle breakdown. Clinical studies on the effects of phenylalanine supplementation post-workout indicate an increase in glycogen replenishment and muscle recovery.  ",Boditronics Splash RecoverEX 1.28kg / 5kg ,Buy Boditronics Splash RecoverEX 1.28kg / 5kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Splash RecoverEX,,,,,Boditronics,Splash RecoverEX,1.28kg / 5kg

These fatty acids activate your body’s natural fat burning enzymes during exercise – encouraging usage of your existing energy stores (fat cells) before digging into your muscles for energy.  Multiple scientific studies demonstrate the effectiveness of fish oil on diet and exercise programs: participants lose more weight, and more importantly more body fat, with the addition of fish oil to their routine with no other changes. Additionally, EPA and DHA are linked to decreased hunger, increased overall metabolic rates, and reduced inflammation in users.Boditronics also added Vitamin E to BodiPure Omega 3.  Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants, by definition, inhibit the oxidation of molecules.  Rust, for example, is the result of metal oxidation.  In your body, free radicals can cause similar types of damage to your cells.  Strenuous exercise increases your body’s production of free radicals.  When you exercise, your body has to process oxygen for energy – with free radicals as the byproduct.  You’ll feel the effects with sore muscles and swelling. Vitamin E is an important vitamin required for several bodily functions, including hair and nail growth and digestion.  Medicinally, Vitamin is used to treat a multitude of illnesses and conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, heart disease, and diabetes.Boditronics BodiPure Omega 3 is more than just a fish oil supplement – it was designed to help improve your overall health. ",Boditronics Bodipure Omega 3 90 gels ,Buy Boditronics Bodipure Omega 3 90 gels from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Boditronics/Bodipure Omega 3,,,,,Boditronics,Bodipure Omega 3,90 gels

It simply works, no matter what your goal or how far along you are in your fitness journey. Extreme Creatine is 100% Creatine Monohydrate.  No fancy fillers or unnecessary ingredients. Extreme Creatine is just the purest creatine available.  Best of all – creatine monohydrate doesn’t require a “loading” or “cycle” period, so you’ll see results immediately. So how does creatine work?  And why creatine monohydrate?At the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O.  You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract.  This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles.Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout.Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine.  Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout.  In food, creatine is found in meat products – but again, not in high quantities.  Creatine supplementation is recommended for nearly all athletes for this reason.Creatine monohydrate is the most widely sold form of creatine, it is the most effective creatine in performance studies.  It is not water-soluble, so don’t expect it to dissolve easily in your recovery drink.  It needs to be ingested quickly so that it does not denature.  That being said, due to its chemical structure, it doesn’t require a loading period before you begin to experience the benefits.",Extreme Nutrition Extreme Creatine 750g ,Buy Extreme Nutrition Extreme Creatine 750g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Extreme Nutrition/Extreme Creatine,,,,,Extreme Nutrition,Extreme Creatine,750g

Here’s a breakdown of BCAA’s:The three potent BCAAs for athletic performance are L-Leucine, l-Valine, and L-Isoleucine.  For maximum benefits, researchers recommend a blend of BCAAs comprised of at least 40% L-Leucine. The remainder should be equal parts Valine and Isoleucine.PhD Nutrition BCAA Intra+ is 50% Leucine and 25% each valine and isoleucine – an ideal blend!Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume branched-chain amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise.  This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore.During exercise, your body oxidizes BCAAs at a very high rate.  If BCAAs are not replenished in a timely manner, muscle recovery and subsequent exercise performance is hindered.  Research studies on BCAA supplementation both prior to and during workouts showed an average of 10-15% more endurance vs. the effects of a placebo.Isolates are the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but since isolates lack the amino acid profiles offered by other types of protein (ie: concentrates), the hydrolyzed whey isolate is a clever addition to this BCAA supplement. Hydrolyzed Protein is isolate that is further broken down, and essentially “pre-digested”.  The smaller peptide chains are more readily absorbed into your bloodstream than any other kind of protein.  However, the process by which hydrolyzed protein is made causes some of the more beneficial properties to denature – again, making it ideal for a blend with amino acids.Coconut water powder helps keep you hydrated and replenishes your electrolytes better than traditional sports drinks.  It is also naturally sweet-tasting, meaning artificial sweeteners are not necessary.",PHD BCAA Intra+ 450g ,Buy PHD BCAA Intra+ 450g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/PHD/BCAA Intra+,,,,,PHD,BCAA Intra+,450g

It is not water-soluble, so don’t expect it to dissolve easily in your recovery drink.  It needs to be ingested quickly so that it does not denature.  That being said, due to its chemical structure, it doesn’t require a loading period before you begin to experience the benefits.",PHD Micronised creatine 250g / 550g ,Buy PHD Micronised creatine 250g / 550g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/PHD/Micronised creatine,,,,,PHD,Micronised creatine,250g / 550g

1149,Omega-3,,Did You Know?,"Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids are considered essential. Like essential amino acids, your body cannot produce them on it’s own.  Therefore it must be supplemented with proper diet.Clinical studies on the effects of diets with sufficient Omega 3 show that obesity and heart disease are much less prevalent. Examples include Japanese and Mediterranean societies, with naturally high amounts of healthy fats in their diets. Conversely, populations with naturally less healthy fats tend to have a lot of trouble with heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity.",https://onlymuscle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Did-You-Know-Banner.jpg,N,75,To be done after Upload,· Omega 3 - DHA & EPA,1,Boost Overall Health|Used medically to treat heart disease and obesity|Naturally lowers bad cholesterol,Joint Health|Omega-3 help lubricate your joints|Shown to boost the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs,Appetite Control|Healthy fats help you feel fuller; less likely to snack between meals|You’ll naturally eat less and are more likely to chose healthy food,"Omega 3 fatty acids benefit improve the function of your whole body: -  Heart health -  Better Skin -  Eye health -  Brain chemistry -  Joint function and lubrication -  Digestive Tract functioningPhD Nutrition Omega-3 features pharmaceutical quality Omega-3 Fish Oil.  Each serving contains: - Omega-3 Fish Oil: 550 mg, of which		EPA: 300 mg		DHA: 220 mg	Fish oils contain two very beneficial and essential Omega 3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA.  These fatty acids activate your body’s natural fat burning enzymes during exercise – encouraging usage of your existing energy stores (fat cells) before digging into your muscles for energy.  Multiple scientific studies demonstrate the effectiveness of fish oil on diet and exercise programs: participants lose more weight, and more importantly more body fat, with the addition of fish oil to their routine with no other changes. Additionally, EPA and DHA are linked to decreased hunger, increased overall metabolic rates, and reduced inflammation in users.Omega-3 and Omega-6 oils are the only fats that become prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are lipid-like compounds that have a hormone-like effect on your body.  They play a role in the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.  Prostaglandins are found as a type of worker bee at sites of infection and muscle tissue damage – including the mild damage you know as sore muscles the day after a tough workoutStrenuous exercise increases your body’s production of free radicals.  When you exercise, your body has to process oxygen for energy – with free radicals as the byproduct.  You’ll feel the effects with sore muscles and swelling. PhD Nutrition Omega-3 is more than just a fish oil supplement – it was designed to help improve your overall health. ",PHD Omega-3 90 caps ,Buy PHD Omega-3 90 caps from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/PHD/Omega-3,,,,,PHD,Omega-3,90 caps

Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey gives you an amazing whey protein with the amino acid profile of whey concentrate and the high absorption rates of a whey isolate.What does Hydrolysed mean?  The protein is partially pre-digested by enzymes into shorter amino chains - which leads to absorption into your system instantly, enabling your muscles to start rebuilding and recovering quickly, making it an ideal post-workout supplement.By providing hydrolyzing whey protein, Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey provides your body with a complete amino acid profile. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids in any form during exercise when compared to a placebo group.Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes.  Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical.  This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels.  When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs.Additionally, studies have shown that hydrolysed protein sources support a better insulin response during ingestion as opposed to intact protein forms. Why does the insulin response matter?Increased insulin plays an important role on the effectiveness of protein synthesis and the storage of glycogen in muscle tissue.  During exercise, your body depletes glycogen stores for energy.  Post-workout supplements, to include supplements taken before a fast (such as sleep), are specially designed to help your muscles rebuild and grow.  This includes replenishing glycogen stores.  Insulin response and glycogen storage are two of the most important aspects of encouraging muscle growth instead of muscle breakdown.",Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey Protein 908g ,Buy Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey Protein 908g from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Vyomax/Hydrolysed Whey Protein,,,,,Vyomax,Hydrolysed Whey Protein,908g

",5,Feed Your Muscles|Microfiltering preserves amino acid profiles and peptides|Whey concentrate helps your muscles absorb essential aminos,Faster Recovery|Fast-digesting whey protein refuels your body instantly|Glutamine kick-starts your muscle recovery,Boost Endurance|The combination of glutamine and whey helps you push longer|Clinically proven ingredients for strength and stamina,"Vyomax Whey Concentrate is created using a base of micro-filtered whey protein. Micro-filtering uses a cold-press process which preserves the integrity of the protein (heat can denature protein powder during processing).  When combined with the other nutrients, Vyomax Whey concentrate is a very well-rounded supplement that would fit any athlete’s needs. Vyomax Whey Concentrate gives you an impressive 28g of quality whey protein concentrate per serving – along with a healthy dose of glutamine and a full amino acid profile to encourage lean muscle growth and recovery.Vyomax Whey Concentrate combines the quick-absorbing effects of whey concentrate with energy-supporting powers of glutamine. Whey concentrate is the most popular type of protein in the supplement world for good reason: it is the least processed, most complete type of protein available. Less processing equals more amino acids and peptides for muscle growth and recovery. Using micro-filtering further preserves the integrity of the amino acids and the bonds between them.  Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume branched-chain amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise.  This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore.As whey protein is quick to digest, it is ideal for post-workout recovery. The anabolic (muscle-building) effects are doubled when combined with glutamine.  Glutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growthGlutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate).",Vyomax Whey Concentrate 2.2kg ,Buy Vyomax Whey Concentrate 2.2kg from us today - Best UK price | Free delivery | Real customer reviews - Only Muscle,/Vyomax/Whey Concentrate,,,,,Vyomax,Whey Concentrate,2.2kg

Created using a cross-flow micro-filtering process, you’ll get 26g of quality protein per serving – and less that one gram each of fat and carbs.Whey isolate is the most easily digestible type of whey, and is perfect for pre- and post-workout supplementation. Even though it doesn’t contain the amino acids that concentrate does, whey isolate is approximately 90% pure protein by weight.Vyomax Whey Protein Isolate is created using a base of micro-filtered whey protein. Micro-filtering uses a cold-press process which preserves the integrity of the protein (heat can denature protein powder during processing).  As whey isolate doesn’t contain the same amino acid profile due to the extra processing it goes through, the micro-filtration is key in preserving the integrity of the amino acids and peptide bonds.Vyomax Whey Protein Isolate also contains minimal amounts of fat and carbohydrates making it an ideal choice for those wanting to limit their carbohydrate and fat intake whilst still benefiting from a high quality protein supplement.Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.
