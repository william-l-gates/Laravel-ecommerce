While physical energy is obviously important in the gym, mental fatigue can wear you out faster than any cardio program. Compounds such as caffeine and glucuronolactone are clinically proven to boost mental focus.The Enduropump Complex contains a proprietary blend of scientifically proven compounds for the best workout and muscular pumps EVER: L-Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced in the body for fat oxidation at the cellular level. Carnitine a so boosts the vascularity of your muscles to help get more oxidized blood through your system. Increased vascularity not only provides much-needed oxygen for energy production, but also gives you a lovely post-workout pump. By providing your cells with more fuel, your muscles will be able to work longer and harder before entering a catabolic state. Preventing muscle breakdown allows for your body’s hormonal receptors to bind with anabolic hormones, resulting in more muscle growth. Citrulline is a relatively new ingredient in the sports supplement game, but arguably the most exciting. Citrulline metabolizes into nitric oxide in your body. It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels. Nitric oxide reduces the amount of oxygen needed in muscle tissue during exercise. Less oxygen consumption translates into boosted power and endurance levels – so you can get the most out of your workout. Beta Alanine is essential to the production of carnosine, a key component of muscle tissue. Carnosine is used quickly during intense exercise, resulting in sore muscles from lactic acid build up as a result of muscle breakdown. Beta Alanine supplementation keeps carnosine levels elevated, ultimately resulting in less muscle breakdown during exercise and significantly improved muscle endurance. This is particularly important to anaerobic exercises like interval training and heavy weight training. Betaine anhydrous, found in beetroot juice, improved muscular force and endurance in athletes undergoing intense anaerobic exercise in several performance studies. Additionally, it is a powerful antioxidant.

They can be added to any training and nutrition program, but are particularly beneficial to beginners and serious athletes. Orange TRIad offers complete multivitamin support, as well as joint, immune and digestion complexes for protection from overuse and illness. The Digestion and Immune Complex includes natural anti-inflammatories and digestive aids to keep your body functioning properly at all levels. Ginger root extract is commonly used to treat stomach discomfort, indigestion and bloating, as well as touting anti-inflammatory properties. Echinacea is recommended to both prevent and treat existing illness as a powerful immune booster. Knotweed root extract is a powerful herbal medicine used to treat everything from sore throat to skin disorders. Glucosamine is a naturally occurring chemical compound found in the human body. As we age, glucosamine levels drop significantly in our systems, contributing to the loss of natural cartilage and subsequent joint pain. Supplementation of glucosamine has been used for years to treat joint pain, stiffness and osteoporosis. While glucosamine supplementation will not prevent injury, it has been shown to aid in recovery of joint damage by encouraging the synthesis of connective tissues. Chondroitin, (similar to glucosamine) is also a naturally occurring substance that decreases as we age. Test subjects in studies on the effects of chondroitin supplementation suffered less joint pain and required fewer painkillers than the placebo groups. MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) is an important element of joint supplementation as it hinders the causes of joint pain and inflammation. MSM provides vital building blocks of not only joints and cartilage, but is also essential in the growth of skin, hair, nails, and supporting various biochemical bodily processes. Hyaluronic Acid is a less common but extremely effective joint supplement as it helps your body produce the synovial fluid needed to lubricate your joints (think oiling a squeaky wheel) and assists in the formation of the collagen your body uses in connective tissues.','Improve Joint Health|Clincally proven ingredients help rebuild joints and reduce inflammation|Replenish your body\'s joint lubricant stores and prevent future damage','Healthy Digestive System|Potent plant-based digestive aids ensure your gut gets healthy and stays that way|Nutrient partitioning makes sure you absorb the vitamins and minerals you need','Boosts your immune system|Echinacea helps prevent sickness and shortens illness duration|Knotweed extract and digestive aids keep you healthy from the inside out','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

B vitamins play a crucial role in cell metabolism, and as such are a common deficiency in athletes. B vitamin deficiency results in significant mental and physical fatigue. Supplementation with B6 encourages amino acid metabolism – particularly of neurotransmitters. B12 is heavily involved in the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats – essential for energy production. The HyperCRE complex features a potent combination of patented Magnesium Creatine Chelate and 2CM (Dicreatine Malate), beneficial during both anaerobic and aerobic workouts and involved in the efficient production and utilization of ATP. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contraction (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). Creatine binds with the by-product of ATP usage, a substance called adenosine di-phosphate (ADP). In order to build more ATP to replenish your body’s energy stores, ADP uses the phosphate molecule bound to creatine to create more ATP.

CLA is a potent supplement with numerous health benefits, most notably for increasing lean muscle mass whilst simultaneously promoting body fat loss. CLA is found naturally in certain protein sources such as red meat, eggs, and high-fat dairy. Unfortunately, modern diets and farming practices have reduced the amount of naturally occurring CLA so much so that athletes are almost guaranteed to require CLA supplementation. Controlled Labs CLAmore encourages usage of your body’s existing fat stores for energy whilst preventing the formation of new fat cells. Scientific studies also suggest that CLA is an effective antioxidant and anti-carcinogen. A double-blind study on the effects of CLA supplementation in athletes found that CLA not only promoted fat loss, but encouraged lean muscle growth – with no other changes to exercise or diet plans! Participants took CLA 3 three times daily and lost significantly more body fat than their counterparts on placebos. By using stored fat as an energy source, your body’s metabolic rate will increase as a result of lean muscle growth. It’s a completely beneficial cycle of lean muscle increase resulting in higher metabolic rates resulting in burning more stored fat, which results in more lean muscle mass. CLA has been shown to actually prevent the formation of new fat cells, therefore helping regulate body fat levels. Medically, CLA is used to help regulate high blood pressure, cholesterol, aid in weight loss, and even limit reactions to food allergies. While CLA is no magic pill, supplementing your diet with CLA might make all the difference.','Lose Body Fat|CLA prevents the formation of new fat cells|Boost your metabolism naturally','Boost Lean Muscle|CLA users maintain lean body mass whilst losing body fat','Appetite Control|CLA regulates insulin levels and healthy glucose response','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

Blue UP uses laboratory-test proven ingredients that raise overall testosterone levels and encourage increases in free (or unbound) testosterone. Free testosterone is what your muscles need to properly grow and build strength. Most testosterone supplements encourage the rise of total testosterone levels whilst ignoring free testosterone levels. Controlled Labs Blue UP addresses both of these issues at the same time. The powerful natural extracts in Controlled Labs Blue UP will ignite your body’s own mechanisms for unbinding testosterone so you can finally see the gains and energy you’ve always wanted. Controlled Labs Blue UP uses a blend of natural plant extracts to boost your total testosterone, free up bound testosterone, and give you extra energy and focus to maximize your workout performance. Tribulus Terrestris is a Mediterranean plant that has been used for centuries in herbal medicine. When harvested after flowering but before hardening into fruit, Tribulus Terrestris yields a powerful substance known as steroidal saponin protodioscin. Saponin works by increasing your body’s luteinizing hormone – the hormone that signals testosterone production in your system. After Tribulus Terrestris signals your body to produce more testosterone, Controlled Labs Blue UP provides you with Avena Sativa to unbind the testosterone so your muscles can better use them. Avena Sativa, found here in the highest standard grade available, works on the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) to break apart the testosterone bound to it. LongJack (Eurycoma Longifolia) is laboratory proven to boost the average male serum testosterone levels by 100% in just 14 days. LongJack helps regulate cortisol levels (which can increase body fat when elevated) and boost overall IGF1 levels. Additionally, LongJack inhibits SHBG from binding with excess testosterone – which can lead to an increase in estrogen levels. For added energy to pump your workouts in the gym, Controlled Labs Blue UP uses caffeine derived from herbal sources and 6.5 mg of yohimbine – the active ingredient in yohimbe.

NRGFuel CLA+ not only encourages usage of existing fat stores, but it has also been shown to be an effective anti-carcinogen and anti-oxidant by protecting your body from free radicals. Naturally occurring CLA is found mostly in red meat and milk fat, but is not present in levels it used to be due to changes in farming practices. As our diets have evolved over time, natural CLA sources are no longer abundant in modern diets. In a double-blind study on the effects of CLA in healthy individuals with regular exercise, athletes that took CLA three times a day for 12 weeks saw a significant decrease in body fat levels compared to those on a placebo. Participants were not asked to alter their diets or exercise plans in any way. Additionally, CLA actually helped increase lean body mass at the same time! By helping your body convert food more efficiently into energy, you’ll boost your metabolism and get more out of every workout. CLA has been shown to actually prevent the formation of new fat cells, therefore helping regulate body fat levels. Medically, CLA is used to help regulate high blood pressure, cholesterol, aid in weight loss, and even limit reactions to food allergies. While CLA is no magic pill, supplementing your diet with CLA might make all the difference.','Lose Body Fat|CLA prevents the formation of new fat cells|Boost your metabolism naturally','Boost Lean Muscle|CLA users maintain lean body mass whilst losing body fat','Appetite Control|CLA regulates insulin levels and healthy glucose response','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

These fatty acids activate your body’s natural fat burning enzymes during exercise – encouraging usage of your existing energy stores (fat cells) before digging into you','Casein Protein Powder',1,'Going longer than 4-5 hours without eating causes your body to enter a ‘fasting’ state, during which time your body is likely to turn to your own protein stores for nutrition. Unfortunately, this means your muscles turn into food. To prevent this from occurring, NRGFuel Casein is designed specifically for ingestion before sleep – when your body is about to fast for the next 7-9 hours. NRGFuel Casein is a time-released fuel full of quality amino acids to keep your body fed through the night. The milk from which both whey and casein protein is processed from is actually around 80% casein, contained mostly in the milk fat. Given that full-fat milk is not consumed regularly in modern diets, casein protein powder is the perfect way to supplement your diet without the additional calories. Usage of casein protein is recommended as part of a healthy weight-loss diet or a great addition to weight-gain diets. The reason casein protein is considered a “time-released protein” is because it forms a gel-like substance in your stomach after ingestion. This means your body has to take more time to break it down as it makes its way through your digestive system. Casein protein is very high in Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs). As protein building blocks, amino acids make up about 33% of human muscle mass. The slow-digesting nature of casein protein ensures a steady stream of BCAAs into your muscles, encouraging protein synthesis (muscle growth). Muscle growth increases your body’s fat oxidation as a fuel source – and in the process helps regulate glucose levels and insulin spikes. By promoting glucose tolerance, your body will utilize more of the fat you have naturally stored as an energy source (and in the process boost your overall metabolic rate). The more fat your body burns from its own stores, the more you’ll see your measurements shrink and your muscles start to pop.','Lasting Energy|Ideal for fasting or endurance activities for steady nutrition|Designed specifically to be consumed prior to sleep','Faster Recovery|BCAAs are clinically proven to help muscles recover faster|You’ll also boost lean muscle growth and burn intramuscular fat','Lose Body Fat|Low-glycemic index nutrition supports glucose tolerance|Promotes use existing fat stores and boosts metabolism','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

NRGFuel Diet Power is the solution to bad tasting, incomplete meal replacement powders. NRGFuel Diet Power is packed with superfood elements, vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and amino acids to help build lean muscle. The primary ingredient in NRGFuel Diet Power is palintose, a low-GI complex carbohydrate that gives you sustained energy without wreaking havoc on your blood sugar and insulin levels. It is considered one of the best carbohydrates sources for athletes. Whey protein is considered the most studied and beneficial protein supplements. It has a wide range of amino acids – the building blocks of any protein – and is known to help boost muscle strength, lean muscle mass and support body fat loss. The amino acids in whey protein help boost your endurance while working out – particularly Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs – and hinder muscle breakdown following exercise. The less muscle breakdown you incur while exercising, the less lactic acid build up your muscles will have, resulting in significantly shorter recovery times. NRGFuel Diet Power’s protein blend is high in the essential amino acid leucine. Leucine is a key building block for healthy, lean muscle. It also helps prevent the loss of muscle tissue following exercise. By keeping healthy, lean muscle tissue your body increase its metabolic rate to keep that muscle fed – leading to a loss of body fat. Hydrolyzed collagen and Omega-3 have been added to NRGFuel Diet Power to boost your joint health, as well as improve your hair and skin health. Combined with vitamin k2-7, your body will feel better than ever with stronger bones and healthier joints. Last but not least, the superfood and vitamin blend in NRGFuel Diet Power is perhaps the most beneficial aspect of this meal replacement. The powers of L-carnitine, great tea and chromium have been touted for centuries to maintain a healthy weight and encourage overall wellness. Vitamins C, E, and selenium will boost your immune system and help you feel like the best version of you whilst you decrease your waistline.','Low-GI Meal Replacement|Palintose provides sustained carb energy without an insulin crash|Both quick and slow digesting proteins for constant nutrient supply','Boost Overall Health|Great on-the-go meal option over junk food|Packed with superfoods, antioxidants, vitamins & minerals','Appetite Control|Healthy fats help you feel fuller; less likely to snack between meals|Omega-3 supplementation is clinically proven to help burn fat','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

With 5g of pure creatine monohydrate per serving, you’ll look better, feel better, and your body will begin to perform as never before. In simple terms: Simply creatine improves your body’s ability to quickly produce muscle-contracting and rapidly recover from training. Ingestion of creatine post-workout replenishes energy stores and encourages muscular water retention – helping you achieve the muscular pump you love to see after a hard training session. Not only do fuller muscles look and feel better, but the added water retention will actually speed up your recovery time by helping keep you hydrated. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine. Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout. Your muscles utilize adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) as a delivery system for energy to muscle cells to force a muscle contraction. The by-product of this process is adenosine di-phosphate, which stays rather useless in your system until it has a chance to bind with the phosphate molecule in creatine and reform into ATP. Unfortunately, your body doesn’t create creatine quickly or in large quantities, making creatine supplementation all but necessary serious athletes.','Increased Endurance|Creatine replenished your ATP, so your muscles can go longer|No loading period is required before you see results!','Boosted Strength|Increased endurance corresponds to increased muscle strength|Build muscle faster than ever','Better Absorption|Creatine Monohydrate absorbs better than other forms of creatine','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

NRGFuels Anabolic Whey’s muscle-building formula includes D Aspartic Acid to naturally boost your testosterone levels in a high-protein, low fat and low carb formula to keep your macronutrients on track. Did we mention it tastes great too? NRGFuel Anabolic Whey isn’t just a protein powder. In addition to D-Aspartic Acid, NRGFuel Anabolic Whey contains glutamine, BCAAs and creatine for a complete supplementation profile to help you reach your fitness goals. D-Aspartic Acid (D-AA) is a form of amino acid widely used as a testosterone booster. It works by causing the brain to release luteinizing, follicle-stimulating, and growth hormones. When your body’s own D-AA levels begin to drop, you can experience fatigue, decreased stamina, and even feel the effects on your libido. Supplementing with quality D-AA on a regular basis helps combat these negative effects by helping your body produce more of its own testosterone. Whey protein contains a naturally high amount of amino acids – the building blocks of protein and an essential element of muscle recovery and growth. The amino acids in whey protein boost muscle endurance while working out and aid muscle growth following exercise. Glutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles. Creatine is a must-have supplement for any serious athlete. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contraction. Following a heavy workout, your body’s ATP stores work overtime to replenish themselves – using creatine to get there. Creatine increases the body’s ability to build ATP. When you’re muscles are full-up on ATP stores, you can contract harder, lifting heavier and building muscle faster.','Feed Your Muscles|Whey concentrate helps your muscles absorb essential aminos|Fast-digesting whey protein refuels your body instantly','Increased Endurance|Amino acids boost blood oxygen levels: more energy for muscles|Increased Nitrogen retention boosts muscle endurance and recovery','Boost Muscle Strength|D-Aspartic Acid releases leutenizing hormone for strength gains|LH stimulates muscle growth hormones','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

Quality protein blend encourages muscle growth, especially when combined with the type of carbohydrates in NutriSport Protein + Carbs. During exercise, your body depletes glycogen stores for energy, uses ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for constant and quick muscle contractions, and temporarily lowers the body’s immune system. To properly refuel and recover to hit the gym again tomorrow, your body needs a carefully balanced and effective food source. Researchers found that combining protein with carbohydrates results in exponentially higher muscle glycogen synthesis. NutriSport Protein + Carbs gives you simple and complex carbohydrates combined with a quality protein source to refill your glycogen stores and jumpstart muscle growth and fat burning. Your body’s muscles are made of approximately 1/3rd amino acids. They need creatine to function properly. Small amounts of creatine are naturally created by your body after eating, but today’s diets rarely give us the creatine required to meet the demanding needs of a high-level fitness lifestyle. This is particularly true for the modern athlete – whether you’re a professional bodybuilder, or even a beginner in the gym. Creatine Ethyl Ester is a creatine derivative that has a better absorption rate in your body that creatine monohydrate.

As a result, Boditronics Express Whey is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market.  \r\rWhat is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.\r\rBoditronics Express Whey is an extremely well-rounded product in that it contains more than just a simple whey protein.  There are two types of whey – concentrate and isolate – to feed your muscles properly in a post-workout anabolic window; a casein protein to keep your muscles fed for up to 7 hours after ingestion; glutamine peptides for muscle growth, MCT oil, and a prebiotic blend to support proper digestion. Boditronics Express Whey contains no artificial colours, flavours, or preservatives.\r\rWhey concentrate and isolate feed your muscles with quick-absorbing protein while casein protein gels in your stomach to provide you with extended release protein. Whey concentrate is the least processed, and therefore most complete, type of whey protein.  It provides a full array of amino acids and peptides.  Whey isolate is the most easily digestible type of whey, and is perfect for pre- and post-workout supplementation.\r\rCasein is the ideal slow-digesting protein, particularly before your body enters a fasting state – such as while you sleep.  The reason casein takes so long to digest is that casein forms a gel-like consistency ball in your stomach. This bundle of protein takes time to break down, which means you’re getting a naturally controlled-release food source.\r\rBy providing three types of protein, Boditronics Express Whey is providing your body with a complete amino acid profile. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.\r\rGlutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes.  Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation with glutamine is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs. To help glutamine absorb more quickly and efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the aminos found Boditronics Express Whey).\r\rMCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides, and occurs naturally in foods like coconut oil. Studied on the effects of MCT oil supplementation show participants lose more body fat, increase their metabolisms and indicate feeling more full overall with less cravings. When MCT oil is digested, it acts more like a carbohydrate than a fat – giving you energy but not storing as fat.\r\rFinally, the prebiotic blend in Boditronics Express Whey ensures the best digestion and absorption possible for a protein powder. Prebiotics are proven in clinical studies to improve nutrient absorption, support immune system, increase “good” bacteria and decrease “bad” bacteria throughout the intestines, and are highly correlated with healthy body weight and appetite control.','Fuels Muscle Growth|BCAA-rich Whey protein helps your muscles build and recover|Slow-digesting Micellar Casein feeds your body for hours','Improves Digestive Health|Encourages healthy digestion and boosts your immune system|o	Increases ‘good’ bacteria and gets rid of “bad” bacteria in the gut',NULL,'2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

By combining clinically proven anabolic ingredients in just the right amounts, this protein powder is the optimal formula for growth and recovery. Whey concentrate is combine with glutamine, a Di-Creatine Complex, and (for the first time!) research-proven D-Aspartic acid. The end result is a high protein, low fat, low carb anabolic growth supplement. Best of all, it has a fantastic taste. \r\rThe anabolic protein blend in Boditronics Express Whey Anaobolic combines the quick-absorbing effects of whey concentrate with energy-supporting powers of glutamine. Whey concentrate is the most popular type of protein in the supplement world for good reason: it is the least processed, most complete type of protein available. Less processing equals more amino acids and peptides for muscle growth and recovery.  \r\rAs whey protein is quick to digest, it is ideal for post-workout recovery. The anabolic (muscle-building) effects are doubled when combined with glutamine.  Glutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growth. \r\rGlutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate). \r\rThe Di-Creatine complex is a unique blend of creatine monohydrate and creatine gluconate. Since each type metabolizes differently, using more than one kind of creatine ensures maximum impact from creatine supplementation. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.\r\rCreatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. Creatine also helps give your muscles a lovely post-workout pump, since it causes your muscles to retain water. \r\rSo how does each type work?\r\rCreatine monohydrate is the most effective form of creatine, according to performance studies. Its chemical structure doesn’t require a loading period (as most creatines do) before the beneficial effects kick in.  However, since it is not water soluble creatine monohydrate must be ingested quickly to avoid denaturing.\r\rCreatine gluconate is relatively new to the supplement world – but it is one of the more exciting developments yet. As most types of creatine are digested in the stomach, not all of it reaches muscle tissue where it is most needed.  Creatine gluconate “games the system” since it is bonded with a glucose molecule.  The glucose molecule causes your stomach to treat it as a simple carbohydrate, so it is digested before the stomach has the opportunity to bind the creatine with water and hang around for a while.  \r\rD-Aspartic Acid is perhaps the most exciting part of Boditronics Express Whey Anabolic. D-aspartic acid is an amino acid that stimulate the release of LH (luteinizing hormone), a precursor to testosterone.  Studies back the efficacy of d-aspartic acid with increases as high as 30-50% more testosterone compared with a placebo group. Testosterone levels are directly correlated with strength, endurance levels, and the ability to grow muscle – making D-Aspartic Acid a perfect addition to this anabolic protein supplement.','Not Done','Not Done','Not Done','2015-09-23 15:41:43','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

A mass gainer with just carbohydrates will help you put on mass – but the problem is the extra “mass” will likely be fat, since excess high glycemic load carbohydrates almost always convert to fat.\r\rBoditronics Mass Attack EVO gives you a massive 40g of protein per serving from 3 different protein sources, along with 60g of low-glycemic load carbohydrates from their unique Ultra Carbohydrate Blend. When combined with glutamine and MCTs, this mass gainer is basically a one-stop-shop for anyone wanting to gain lean muscle without a layer of fat most mass gainers result in. \r\rFirst: the proteins. Boditronics Mass Attack EVO uses three types of protein for a truly amino acid-rich time release blend. Boditronics uses a specific kind of cold press to prevent denatured proteins and amino acids.  As a result, the whey concentrate in Mass Attack EVO is some of the highest quality protein in terms of bioavailability on the market.  What is bioavailability?  In simple terms, it means that your body will be able to absorb the protein and all of its components in their purest, most beneficial form.  This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.\r\rWhey concentrate feeds your muscles with quick-absorbing protein while casein protein gels in your stomach to provide you with extended release protein. Whey concentrate is the least processed, and therefore most complete, type of whey protein.  It provides a full array of amino acids and peptides.  Casein is the ideal slow-digesting protein, particularly before your body enters a fasting state – such as while you sleep.  The reason casein takes so long to digest is that casein forms a gel-like consistency ball in your stomach. This bundle of protein takes time to break down, which means you’re getting a naturally controlled-release food source.\r\rThe third protein source is a soy isolate.  Soy protein is naturally high in fiber – necessary for proper digestion in high-protein diets. The important part is the isolate: isolates are the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight. \r\rThe UltraCarb Blend in Boditronics Mass Attack EVO was formulated as a 4 stage low glycemic load featuring Ground Whole Oats, Barley Malt, Whole Durum Wheat and Waxy Maize Starch. This blend is particularly high in vitamins, minerals and overall nutrient content – all but replacing parts of the typical multivitamin.  By using low-glycemic load sources, your body is getting a contant stream of slow-digesting energy that encourages muscle growth instead of fat storage.  \r\rGlutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growth. Glutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate).\r\rCompleting the nutritional profile in Boditronics Mass Attack EVO is the addition of MCT to boost metabolism.  MCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides, and occurs naturally in foods like coconut oil.  When MCT oil is digested, it acts more like a carbohydrate than a fat – giving you energy but not storing as fat.  Due to their structure, they don’t follow the usual digestive channels for fat.  And since they aren’t actually carbohydrates, your body won’t trigger an insulin response in an attempt to put it into fat storage.','Not Done','Not Done','Not Done','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

Designed specifically for “hardgainers” (those who have a hard time gaining and maintaining weight due to their sky-high metabolisms), one serving provides a massive 71 grams of high-quality protein and 220 grams of carbohydrates.  The Heavyweight blend also includes a Heavyweight Gain Stack of creatine and dextrose monohydrate to create the optimal muscle-building environment.\r\rBoditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight uses two types of protein for a truly amino acid-rich blend.

This translates into you getting the most possible out of your protein powder to support your fitness goals.\r\rUnlike most mass gain supplements, the carbohydrate Ultimate Energy Blend in Boditronics Mass Attack Heavyweight isn’t straight simple sugars. While the maltodextrin provides the quick energy you’d expect, the addition of whole grain oats and MCTs gives you a steady, low-glycemic load energy source to power you for hours.  \r\rWhole grain oats are a wonderful source of nutrients, and since they don’t digest super fast there’s no big insulin spike.

And since they aren’t actually carbohydrates, your body won’t trigger an insulin response in an attempt to put it into fat storage.\r\rThe Heavyweight Gain Stack in this product is particularly exciting.  Creatine is extremely well-known and loved for its muscle-promoting properties. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.\r\rCreatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. By combining creatine with the dextrose molecule, Bodiitronics Mass Attack Heavyweight encourages rapid absorption of creatine into the bloodstream.','Not Done','Not Done','Not Done','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids).  For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial.  \r\rGlutamine is considered a non-essential amino acid. Non-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that, most of the time, they do not need to be supplemented by your diet.  That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly.  \r\rFor medical purposes, non-essential amino acids are often reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile.\r\rAmino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes.  Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical.  This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels.  When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs.\r\rThe health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles.  They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss.  Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer\r\rGlutamine is by far the most common amino acid in the human body.  As such, the body relies heavily on it for countless bodily processes.  The more stress you place your body under, especially with physical exertion, the faster you’ll use up your glutamine stores.\r\rGlutamine deficiency is common in serious athletes.  Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system.

This supplement will help you push harder in the gym, lift heavier, go longer, build more muscle mass, and provide intense post-workout pumps.  Here’s how:\r\rCreatine HCL (hydrochloride) is the newest form of creatine available. It gives all of the same effects of other types of creatine with a smaller doses, and with less stomach discomfort.  This will replenish and build energy stores in your muscles, and you should start seeing a notable difference in you exercise endurance, strength level, and overall recovery times.\r\rBeta-alanine is primarily intended for athletes who are constantly using the same muscles, without the ability to take a break and recover for a few days. The effects of creatine plus beta-alanine on strength, power, body composition, and endocrine changes were examined during a 10-week resistance-training program in collegiate athletes. Results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of creatine plus beta-alanine on strength performance. Creatine plus beta-alanine supplementation appeared to have the greatest effect on lean tissue accruement and body fat composition\r\rCitrulline malate helps to recycle l-argenine through your system for extra energy, removing ammonia at the same time to help lower the acidic environment created by intense training. Citrulline metabolizes into nitric oxide in your body.  It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels. Nitric oxide reduces the amount of oxygen needed in muscle tissue during exercise.  Less oxygen consumption translates into boosted power and endurance levels – so you can get the most out of your workout.\r\rArginine is used in fat metabolism, release of growth hormones, fighting free radicals (antioxidant effect), and protein synthesis (precursor to muscle growth).\rWhen arginine is metabolized, it is converted into nitric oxide – thus making it one of the best ways to increase nitric oxide levels in your system.  Athletes love the effect of nitric oxide for the extra energy it gives them.  It dilates blood vessels, improving blood flow and energy levels.\r\rTaurine is commonly found in energy drinks, as they it known for boosting mental alertness, fighting fatigue, improving your mood, and controlling your appetite. It contains natural caffeine and other phenolic-containing antioxidant compounds. \r\rGlucuronolactone, a metabolite of glucose, has extremely positive effects on mood and altertness. This will provide additional alertness in the gym and help regulate your glycogen – which translates into better performance and more overall energy.\r\rL-tyrosine is an amino acid that supports cognitive function that typically diminishes after physical and mental exhaustion.  Mental endurance plays a huge role in overall physical performance.  Tyrosine is popular in energy drinks for this reason.\r\rLast but not least: caffeine.

It does this by stimulating white blood cell production – the little army of infection fighting soldiers in your blood.\r\rAthletes are at particular risk for zinc deficiency, since exercise increases rate at which zinc is used up.  Since athletes tend to be more conscious of their diets, they can run even more of a risk by limiting the variety of foods they eat.  This often includes natural sources of zinc. When zinc levels are compromised, you can suffer from extreme fatigue, poor digestion, and loss of neuromuscular control.  Your appearance can suffer as well, since low zinc levels will affect your skin and hair health.\r\rZinc, as a trace mineral with antioxidant properties, is clinically proven to increase testosterone and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1).  Conversely, studies where participants were asked to avoid zinc-containing foods for a few weeks saw dramatic drops in their overall testosterone levels.

Best of all – creatine monohydrate doesn’t require a “loading” or “cycle” period, so you’ll see results immediately. \r\rSo how does creatine work?  And why creatine monohydrate?\r\rAt the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O.  You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract.  This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles.\r\rYour body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body).  The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give.  Enter: Creatine.\r\rCreatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule.  Now, your ATP stores are building back up.  Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout.\r\rCreatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine.  Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout.  In food, creatine is found in meat products – but again, not in high quantities.  Creatine supplementation is recommended for nearly all athletes for this reason.\r\rCreatine monohydrate is the most widely sold form of creatine, it is the most effective creatine in performance studies.  It is not water-soluble, so don’t expect it to dissolve easily in your recovery drink.  It needs to be ingested quickly so that it does not denature.  That being said, due to its chemical structure, it doesn’t require a loading period before you begin to experience the benefits.','Increased Endurance|Creatine replenished your ATP, so your muscles can go longer|No loading period is required before you see results!','Boosted Strength|Increased endurance corresponds to increased muscle strength|Boost your muscle gains faster than ever','Better Absorption|Creatine Monohydrate absorbs better than other forms of creatine','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:09'),

Here’s a breakdown of BCAA’s:\r\rThe three potent BCAAs for athletic performance are L-Leucine, l-Valine, and L-Isoleucine.  For maximum benefits, researchers recommend a blend of BCAAs comprised of at least 40% L-Leucine. The remainder should be equal parts Valine and Isoleucine.\r\rPhD Nutrition BCAA Intra+ is 50% Leucine and 25% each valine and isoleucine – an ideal blend!\r\rAmino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume branched-chain amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.\r\rBranched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise.  This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore.\r\rDuring exercise, your body oxidizes BCAAs at a very high rate.  If BCAAs are not replenished in a timely manner, muscle recovery and subsequent exercise performance is hindered.  Research studies on BCAA supplementation both prior to and during workouts showed an average of 10-15% more endurance vs. the effects of a placebo.\r\rIsolates are the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body.  It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but since isolates lack the amino acid profiles offered by other types of protein (ie: concentrates), the hydrolyzed whey isolate is a clever addition to this BCAA supplement. \r\rHydrolyzed Protein is isolate that is further broken down, and essentially “pre-digested”.  The smaller peptide chains are more readily absorbed into your bloodstream than any other kind of protein.  However, the process by which hydrolyzed protein is made causes some of the more beneficial properties to denature – again, making it ideal for a blend with amino acids.\r\rCoconut water powder helps keep you hydrated and replenishes your electrolytes better than traditional sports drinks.  It is also naturally sweet-tasting, meaning artificial sweeteners are not necessary.','Faster Recovery|BCAAs are clinically proven to help muscles recover faster|You’ll also boost lean muscle growth and burn intramuscular fat','Maximum Absorption|Hydrolyzed protein absorbs more completely in your stomach|Whey Isolate is approximately 90% pure protein by weight','Increased Endurance|Amino acids boost blood oxygen levels: more energy for muscles|Increased Nitrogen retention boosts muscle endurance and recovery','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:10'),

Each serving contains:\r - Omega-3 Fish Oil: 550 mg, of which\r		EPA: 300 mg\r		DHA: 220 mg\r	\r\rFish oils contain two very beneficial and essential Omega 3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA.  These fatty acids activate your body’s natural fat burning enzymes during exercise – encouraging usage of your existing energy stores (fat cells) before digging into your muscles for energy.  \r\rMultiple scientific studies demonstrate the effectiveness of fish oil on diet and exercise programs: participants lose more weight, and more importantly more body fat, with the addition of fish oil to their routine with no other changes. \r\rAdditionally, EPA and DHA are linked to decreased hunger, increased overall metabolic rates, and reduced inflammation in users.\r\rOmega-3 and Omega-6 oils are the only fats that become prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are lipid-like compounds that have a hormone-like effect on your body.  They play a role in the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.  Prostaglandins are found as a type of worker bee at sites of infection and muscle tissue damage – including the mild damage you know as sore muscles the day after a tough workout\r\rStrenuous exercise increases your body’s production of free radicals.  When you exercise, your body has to process oxygen for energy – with free radicals as the byproduct.  You’ll feel the effects with sore muscles and swelling. \r\rPhD Nutrition Omega-3 is more than just a fish oil supplement – it was designed to help improve your overall health.','Boost Overall Health|Used medically to treat heart disease and obesity|Naturally lowers bad cholesterol','Joint Health|Omega-3 help lubricate your joints|Shown to boost the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs','Appetite Control|Healthy fats help you feel fuller; less likely to snack between meals|You’ll naturally eat less and are more likely to chose healthy food','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:10'),

Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey gives you an amazing whey protein with the amino acid profile of whey concentrate and the high absorption rates of a whey isolate.\r\rWhat does Hydrolysed mean?  The protein is partially pre-digested by enzymes into shorter amino chains - which leads to absorption into your system instantly, enabling your muscles to start rebuilding and recovering quickly, making it an ideal post-workout supplement.\r\rBy providing hydrolyzing whey protein, Vyomax Hydrolysed Whey provides your body with a complete amino acid profile. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body.  This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. \r\rIn fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids in any form during exercise when compared to a placebo group.\r\rAmino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes.  Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical.  This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels.  When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs.\r\rAdditionally, studies have shown that hydrolysed protein sources support a better insulin response during ingestion as opposed to intact protein forms. \r\rWhy does the insulin response matter?\r\rIncreased insulin plays an important role on the effectiveness of protein synthesis and the storage of glycogen in muscle tissue.  During exercise, your body depletes glycogen stores for energy.  Post-workout supplements, to include supplements taken before a fast (such as sleep), are specially designed to help your muscles rebuild and grow.  This includes replenishing glycogen stores.  Insulin response and glycogen storage are two of the most important aspects of encouraging muscle growth instead of muscle breakdown.','Faster Recovery|BCAAs are clinically proven to help muscles recover faster|You’ll also boost lean muscle growth and burn intramuscular fat','Maximum Absorption|Whey protein isolate absorbs more completely in your stomach|Whey Isolate is approximately 90% pure protein by weight','Increased Endurance|Amino acids boost blood oxygen levels: more energy for muscles|Increased Nitrogen retention boosts muscle endurance and recovery','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:10'),

In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume branched-chain amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group.\r\rBranched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes.  BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise.  This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore.\r\rAs whey protein is quick to digest, it is ideal for post-workout recovery. The anabolic (muscle-building) effects are doubled when combined with glutamine.  Glutamine is the most abundant amino acids in the body, making deficiency quite common in serious athletes. Glutamine helps fight muscle fatigue, muscle breakdown, and supports your immune system. Supplementation is highly recommended for athletes participating in strenuous exercise programs – such as the bulking programs designed to promote muscle growth\r\rGlutamine doesn’t absorb into muscles on it’s own. To help glutamine absorb more efficiently, it needs to bond with a peptide to help it hitch a ride with amino acids into your muscles (such as the amino acids found in whey concentrate).','Feed Your Muscles|Microfiltering preserves amino acid profiles and peptides|Whey concentrate helps your muscles absorb essential aminos','Faster Recovery|Fast-digesting whey protein refuels your body instantly|Glutamine kick-starts your muscle recovery','Boost Endurance|The combination of glutamine and whey helps you push longer|Clinically proven ingredients for strength and stamina','2015-09-23 15:41:44','2015-10-01 04:48:10'),

	(728,1,'How will All in One Supplements help me?','All-in-One supplements are exactly what they imply: all the ingredients you might require for your nutritional needs, in one convenient delivery system. All-in-One, however, does not necessarily mean universally beneficial. Different people need different types of nutrition, depending on their training and nutritional goals. Ingredients universal to the majority of all-in-one supplements include protein (often more than one kind), carbohydrates, creatine, amino acids, and often a vitamin blend. Additional ingredients vary based on the goal of the specific supplement: general meal replacement, diet supplement, post-workout, mass gainer, ect… All-in-One supplements often contain superfood blends and healthy fats. These are designed to bridge the nutritional gap in the average individual’s diet. Superfood blends usually contain an array of vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables, particularly of those known for their health benefits, such as acai. The superfood blends contain the key components (vitamins and minerals) in higher quantities than eating the daily-recommended amount of fruits and vegetables alone. \nHealthy fats are essential to weight management and insulin control. The nature of modern diets, particularly restrictive and weight loss diets, results in healthy fats often being left out due to caloric content.

These supplements are usually much more palatable, and healthier, than typical diet food. Superfood and vitamin blends are particularly beneficial to dieters, since restrictive diets can lead to multiple deficiencies. Post-Workout: Every serious athlete knows about the post workout window in which you should replenish your carbohydrate (glycogen) stores and provide your muscles with quality protein, amino acids, and creatine to repair and build. Post-workout all-in-one supplements often double as meal replacements. They usually contain both fast and slow digesting protein and carbohydrates. A vitamin blend is also important to protect your hard-working immune system. Mass/Weight Gainers: This is where All-in-One supplements shine. As frustrating as it can be for overweight individuals to lose weight, it’s sometimes more frustrating for “hard gainers” to put on weight. There are so many options available for weight loss, but not many for individuals who want to gain mass. Eating constantly to meet high-calorie diets can be tiring and time consuming.

Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.

	(732,2,'How to tell good Amino Acid Supplements from the bad ones','As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. \nNon-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system.

This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sor\nBranched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are a necessity for athletes strength training. Human muscle mass is comprised of approximately 33% BCAAs, and unfortunately our modern diets (even healthy ones) do not contain the BCAAs your body needs to be at your best. Naturally, numerous scientific studies boast of the benefits of BCAA supplementation for athletes of all ages and fitness levels.During exercise, your body oxidizes BCAAs at a very high rate. If BCAAs are not replenished in a timely manner, muscle recovery and subsequent exercise performance is hindered. Research studies on BCAA supplementation both prior to and during workouts showed an average of 10-15% more endurance vs. the effects of a placebo.The three potent BCAAs for athletic performance are L-Leucine, l-Valine, and L-Isoleucine. For maximum benefits, researchers recommend a blend of BCAAs comprised of at least 40% L-Leucine. The remainder should be equal parts Valine and Isoleucine.BCAAs promote not only muscle growth, but fat oxidation and hormone balance. By promoting glucose tolerance, your body will utilize more of the fat you have naturally stored as an energy source (and in the process boost your overall metabolic rate).The most immediate and notable effect from BCAA supplementation is how much more endurance you’ll have during, and how much less sore your muscles will feel following a tough workout. As they are the building block of muscle tissue, they inhibit muscle breakdown. Breaking down less muscle means less lactic acid build-up. Subsequently, you’ll recover faster and feel less sore overall the next day.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),

Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.

Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. \nNon-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth.

	(761,12,'How will Protein Bars help me?','Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet. Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(762,12,'How to tell good Protein Bars from the bad ones','As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator.

	(853,42,'What is 5 methoxy-isoflavone?','Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet.

	(857,43,'Are Amino Acids products for me?','As mentioned above, there are both essential and non-essential amino acids. Your body actually relies on over 200 separate amino acids to fully function, but for the purposes of health and fitness we will focus on the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are the complex amino acids that are considered the building blocks of complex proteins in your body. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair, hair and nail health, and overall cellular maintenance. Listed here are the essential and semi-essential amino acids used in sports supplements. Essential amino acids cannot be made by your body, and subsequently need to be provided by food. Semi-essential amino acids are created in very small amounts in your system, but not in the quantities your body needs to run properly. For this reason, and for our purposes here, they are considered essential. The first three amino acids listed are what are known as the three Branched-Chain Amino Acids. They are particularly beneficial for sports training. L-Leucine – This is the single most-beneficial amino acid to the athletic population. It plays a key role in the creation and preservation of muscle tissue. Leucine is also vital to several healing processes throughout the body. L-Isoleucine – Isoleucine is similar to leucine and valine in its role in both energy and healing processes, but is particularly important in endurance training (and fasting). L-Valine – Helps the body’s energy delivery systems run properly, and is directly responsible in muscle strength and endurance processes. L-Lysine – Your immune system is very reliant on lysine, as it uses the same energy transports as viruses – thereby reducing a viruses ability to fully “take hold”. Lysine is also key to creating collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair. L- Methionine – Aids the building of certain proteins in the body while playing a crucial role in fighting infection and allergies. L-Phenylalanine – The way phenylalanine is processed in our body is not fully understood yet. However, its benefits are widely known for treating depression, ADHD, chronic pain, and certain skin conditions. L-Threonine – Your body processes Threonine into a chemical called glycine, a particularly important element in brain health. L-Tryptophan – Tryptophan plays a crucial role in your nervous system, producing the messengers that deliver signals to various parts of your body. It is used to treat depression and mental illness. L-Arginine – Most well-known for it’s role in interacting with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. During exercise, this reaction produces a great muscular pump and gives your muscles additional energy. L-Cysteine – Plays a key role in metabolic cycles and cell detoxification. L- Histidine – This amino acid is especially important during infancy to keep a baby’s body growing properly. Histidine is used to boost the immune system and stimulate tissue repair. L-Tyrosine – Most commonly known to treat the genetic condition phenylketonuria, tyrosine is used in a number of medical applications ranging from mood disorders to Alzheimer’s disease and chronic fatigue. \nNon-essential amino acids are created by your body in such sufficient quantities that they do not need to be supplemented by your diet. That being said, during times of stress (aka exercise) and illness, you body uses up its amino acid supply quite rapidly. For medical purposes, non-essential amino acids can be reclassified into semi-essential amino acids. Serious athletes of all levels of fitness will benefit from supplementation with a complete amino acid profile. L-Alanine – Along with Glutamine, this is the most important nutrient to amino acid metabolism. Alanine is used to prevent and treat low blood sugar by releasing glucose into your blood stream. L-Asparagine - Is important in the development and function of the brain. Asparagine Acid – Also known as Aspartic Acid, this amino acid stimulates brain receptors and plays a key role in several metabolic processes. L-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid – A very popular strength supplement, Glutamine increases water retention and signals cell growth. L-Glycine – The smallest amino acid, Glycine plays a critical role in the functioning of your central nervous system and digestive system. L-Proline – Proline is becoming increasingly popular for it’s role in skin health, and is said to have anti-aging properties L-Serine – This amino acid is most popular for its treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other neurological disorders','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),

	(892,55,'What is Creatine?','First, a little background: At the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O. You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract. This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give. Enter: Creatine. Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule. Now, your ATP stores are building back up. Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine. Your body produces creatine in very small amounts, and this small supply is easily expended during a tough workout. In food, creatine is found in meat products – but again, not in high quantities. Creatine supplementation is recommended for nearly all athletes for this reason.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(893,55,'Are Creatine products for me?','Since the purpose of creatine is to replenish and build energy stores in your muscles, you should start seeing a notable difference in you exercise endurance, strength level, and overall recovery times. Most creatine supplements recommend a “loading phase”, since creatine takes time to build up in your system. Don’t be surprised if it takes up to two weeks to notice a difference. Creatine is lesser known for giving athletes a bit of a post-workout pump. After ingestion, creatine causes muscle cells to retain more water. This means that you need to hydrate especially well when taking creatine, but the extra water not only gives you a fuller look, but will help you recover faster. Due to the nature of their dietary restrictions, vegetarians and vegans benefit most from creatine supplementation.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(894,55,'How to tell good Creatine supplements from bad ones','Creatine is available in several forms. While there is debate as to which type of creatine works best, scientific studies are overall inconclusive. Unfortunately, an EFSA study found that over half of the creatine supplements available today contain contaminants. Bottom line: the most important factor is the standards by which the creatine is processed for purity. Creatine supplements differ by composition, solubility, and effectiveness. Creatine Monohydrate: The most widely sold form of creatine, it is usually the most effective creatine in performance studies. It is not water-soluble, so don’t expect it to dissolve easily in your recovery drink. It needs to be ingested quickly so that it does not denature. That being said, due to its chemical structure, it doesn’t require a loading period before you begin to experience the benefits. Micronized Creatine: Micronized creatine is creatine monohydrate that has been, well… micronized. This means that the creatine molecules have been decreased in size to improve absorption. While it does require a loading phase, the ease of absorption reduces side effects associated with regular creatine monohydrate – namely bloating and stomach discomfort from water retention. However, athletes that don’t respond to creatine monohydrate should respond particularly well to micronized creatine. Additionally, the additional processing required to make micronized creatine results in an almost universally pure product. Creatine Ethyl Ester: This form of creatine is bonded to an ester molecule. The importance of this additional molecule is that it changes the overall ionic charge of the molecule. By doing this, creatine ethyl ester’s absorption rate is nearly 99%. Like creatine monohydrate, creatine ethyl ester does not require a loading phase. There is no stomach discomfort or bloating associated with this form of creatine. Creatine Citrate: Like creatine ethyl ester, creatine citrate is creatine that has been bonded to an additional molecule (citric acid) to increase overall absorption. Creatine citrate is more stable than creatine monohydrate, and is slightly more water-soluble. This form of creatine is rarely found in its own supplement – it is usually combined with other supplements such as All-in-One’s or Meal Replacements Creatine Malate: Creatine Malate is another bonded creatine – in this case it is bonded with malic acid to boost absorption levels. As with other forms of bonded creatine, stomach discomfort is much less likely to occur. Creatine malate comes in two forms: tri-creatine malate and di-creatine malate. Tri creatine malate contains 3 monohydrate molecules, and di0creatine malate has two. The additional monohydrate molecules, in addition to the malic acid, aid in the formation of ATP at the cellular level.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(895,56,'What is Creatine Monohydrate?','First, a little background: At the end of a long run or a tough workout, your muscles feel like Jell-O. You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract. This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give. Enter: Creatine. Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule. Now, your ATP stores are building back up. Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout.

	(1003,92,'What is Protein?','Protein is one of the major macronutrients (the others being Fat and Carbohydrates). It is naturally abundant in foods such as meat, dairy products, nuts and beans. Protein is vital to every critical function in the body. Protein is comprised of amino acids – another supplement often found on its own. Your muscles are made of amino acids (as a foundation) and use amino acids to build and repair, as well as fuel bodily functions. Amino acids are also important building blocks for healthy skin, hair, nails and bone density. Therefore, individuals that don’t get enough protein in their diets often find that their overall health and appearance will suffer, even if they are otherwise healthy. Even as recent as 100 years ago, protein was the main source of caloric intake in human diets. However, the rise of industry, mass food production, and changes to the typical modern diet has resulted in a shift toward carbohydrates and unhealthy fats as the primary source of calories (cereal, bread, pasta). \nQuality protein sources tend to be more expensive now, and are generally more work to cook and prepare for the busy individual. Protein supplements are ideal to meet nutritional needs quickly and conveniently.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(1004,92,'Are Protein products for me?','Typical protein supplements can range anywhere from 30-95% protein by weight. The type of protein and the way in which it is processed determines the quality of the supplement. \nConcentrate, Isolate, and Hydrolyzed (based on whey – the most common kind of protein): \nProtein Concentrate is generally the most affordable protein as it is the least processed and generally the most complete in terms of amino acids and peptides. However, it is also the most varied in terms of the amount of protein per gram. \nProtein Isolate is the most pure form of protein available, and the most easily absorbed by your body. It is generally 88-95% protein per weight, but often lacking in complete amino profiles offered by concentrate. Hydrolyzed Protein is isolate that is further broken down, and essentially “pre-digested”. The smaller peptide chains are more readily absorbed into your bloodstream than any other kind of protein. However, the process by which hydrolyzed protein is made causes some of the more beneficial properties to denature.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
	(1005,92,'How to tell good Protein supplements from bad ones','Animal-based proteins: Whey and Casein, and Egg Both proteins come from dairy milk. The milk you buy at the grocery store is about 20% whey and 80% casein protein. The difference between the two is how your body digests them. Whey is often considered the ideal fast-acting protein since it is so easily absorbed – perfect for post-workout replenishment and growth. Whey protein is particularly high in essential amino acids – meaning the ones your body doesn’t produce and needs to get from food to function properly. Since it is the most popular and most common type of protein, whey is available in a myriad of flavours and forms. Casein protein has a different amino acid profile than whey, and is very slowly digested. This protein is ideal for endurance performance and highly recommended prior to any period of fasting (ie: sleep!). Casein forms a gel-like substance in your stomach after ingestion, so your body takes much longer to process it than whey. This translates into a very steady stream of amino acids over a long period of time (usually 7 hours or so). Egg Protein is made from a process that involved separating the yolks from the white and dehydrating the whites. It is very protein dense, providing approximately 4 times the amount found in one egg in per serving. Eggs are naturally high in vitamins and minerals, making them a great option for the lactose-intolerant crowd. Plant-Based Protein: Plant-based proteins are constantly growing in popularity for lactose intolerant, gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian populations. These proteins make it easier for people on limited diets to meet their protein needs. Plants are naturally high in fiber and don’t often need the same artificial flavouring that other protein sources use. Plant proteins are varied in their vitamin and amino profiles, yet they can be more robust than some animal proteins in this respect. For this reason, plant proteins are usually combined to give the most complete nutritional profile. \nTypes of plant-based proteins (not all-inclusive): hemp, soy, rice, pea, beans, flaxseed, cranberry, alfalfa,','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),

You may have muscles what are just plain failing to contract. This feeling is caused by depleted ATP stores in your muscles. Your body uses ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) to deliver energy to cells for muscle contractions (and just about every other energy-involved process in your body). The byproduct of this process is ADP (adenosine di-phosphate), which is essentially useless to your body. In order to get ahold of another phosphate molecule to become ATP again, your body needs something with a phosphate molecule to give. Enter: Creatine. Creatine binds with ADP, at which point it loses a phosphate molecule. Now, your ATP stores are building back up. Over time, creatine supplementation will help your muscles last longer and feel stronger by ensuring you’ve got more energy (ATP) before you begin your workout. Creatine is a blend of three different amino acids: arginine, methionine, and glycine.

	(1036,41,'What is Whey Protein?','Amino acids are essential to the composition and function of the human body. Your body produces some amino acids on it’s own (known as non-essential amino acids) and needs to get others from food (essential amino acids). For the average individual amino acid supplementation isn’t always necessary, but is always beneficial. Amino acids are found abundantly in protein rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and legumes. Your body uses amino acids quickly during times of stress, both mental and physical. This puts both serious athletes and busy, stressed individuals at risk for low amino acid blood levels. When this happens, your body will struggle to keep up and will often break down protein in your existing muscles to scavenge what it needs. The health benefits of even small amounts of amino acids are well documented in medical circles. They are often prescribed to bedridden patients to prevent or delay muscle loss. Doctors use amino acids to help treat a variety of medical conditions, from brain swelling to cancer. Amino acids work by helping stimulate protein synthesis and muscle building throughout the body. This mechanism is particularly beneficial to athletes, since exercise causes muscle breakdown of various degrees. In fact, scientific studies demonstrate an increase in protein synthesis by as much as 150% in athletes that consume amino acids during exercise when compared to a placebo group. Branched-Chain Amino Acids, or BCAAs, are the most common form of amino acid supplementation for athletes. BCAA supplementation increases blood oxygen levels and nitrogen retention during and after workouts, giving you more energy and improving your muscle’s ability to rebuild after exercise. This translates to faster recoveries between workouts and muscles that won’t feel as sore. Though BCAAs are beneficial to athletic performance, they are not the only kind of amino acid your body needs to perform at it’s best. For maximum health benefits, it is important to consume a complete amino acid profile – just as it is important to consume a variety of protein and carbohydrates for a healthy diet. Each amino acid plays a different role in your body’s metabolism and mechanics.','2015-10-01 04:46:09','2015-10-01 04:46:09'),
